# kumo-stream Specs

Branch requirement (critical)

- All kumo-stream work for this project must land on the `geoquant/streaming-ui` branch.
- Specs in this directory are written assuming that branch context (history, constraints, existing decisions).

Why

- kumo-stream is a reference impl; branch drift is how we accidentally fork behavior.
