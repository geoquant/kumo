# Progress Log
PRD: Flow Generative Support + Pipeline Consolidation
Started: 2026-02-27

## Codebase Patterns
<!-- Consolidate reusable patterns here -->
- Discovery fallback pattern: resolve from `index.ts` exports first, then map export/import identifiers to source files; this handles non-conventional component filenames safely.

## Task - [d1-discovery-fallback]
- Implemented and validated discovery fallback coverage for non-conventional components exported via `index.ts`.
- Files changed: `packages/kumo/scripts/component-registry/discovery.ts`, `packages/kumo/scripts/component-registry/discovery.test.ts`, `.opencode/state/Flow Generative Support + Pipeline Consolidation/prd.json`, `.opencode/state/Flow Generative Support + Pipeline Consolidation/progress.txt`.
- **Learnings:** fallback resolution should check `.tsx` and `.ts` source targets to avoid coupling discovery to UI-only file extensions.
