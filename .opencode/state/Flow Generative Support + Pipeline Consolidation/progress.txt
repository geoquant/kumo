# Progress Log
PRD: Flow Generative Support + Pipeline Consolidation
Started: 2026-02-27

## Codebase Patterns
<!-- Consolidate reusable patterns here -->
- Discovery fallback pattern: resolve from `index.ts` exports first, then map export/import identifiers to source files; this handles non-conventional component filenames safely.
- Manifest derivation pattern: emit unified runtime lookup tables from existing manifest primitives (`TYPE_ALIASES`, `SUB_COMPONENT_ALIASES`) so prompt/validator/map consumers read one generated SSOT.

## Task - [d1-discovery-fallback]
- Implemented and validated discovery fallback coverage for non-conventional components exported via `index.ts`.
- Files changed: `packages/kumo/scripts/component-registry/discovery.ts`, `packages/kumo/scripts/component-registry/discovery.test.ts`, `.opencode/state/Flow Generative Support + Pipeline Consolidation/prd.json`, `.opencode/state/Flow Generative Support + Pipeline Consolidation/progress.txt`.
- **Learnings:** fallback resolution should check `.tsx` and `.ts` source targets to avoid coupling discovery to UI-only file extensions.

## Task - [d4-manifest-ssot]
- Implemented unified manifest derivations in codegen: `TYPE_RESOLUTION_MAP` (alias + sub-component lookup) and `ALL_GENERATIVE_TYPES` (deduped sorted union).
- Files changed: `packages/kumo/scripts/component-registry/generative-map-generator.ts`, `packages/kumo/src/generative/component-manifest.ts`, `.opencode/state/Flow Generative Support + Pipeline Consolidation/prd.json`, `.opencode/state/Flow Generative Support + Pipeline Consolidation/progress.txt`.
- **Learnings:** keeping generated manifest tables sorted stabilizes downstream diffs and makes drift checks deterministic.
