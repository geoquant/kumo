# Progress Log
PRD: agents-md-compliance
Started: 2026-02-21
Branch: geoquant/kumo-regression-prevention (DO NOT switch)

## Codebase Patterns
<!-- Consolidate reusable patterns here -->
- AGENTS.md locations: root, packages/kumo, packages/kumo-docs-astro, packages/kumo-figma, ci/
- All 5 files present as of task start
- Accurate counts: 38 components, 38 primitives, 44 demos + 2 non-demo, 3 blocks, 6 workflows, 6 lint rules
- Docs: 37 component pages, 3 block pages
- CLI commands: ls, doc, add, blocks, init, migrate, ai (7 total)
- Scoring candidates evaluated: lint/ (6 files, skip), .github/ (7 files, skip), kumo/scripts/ (20 files, child of existing), _examples/ (3 example projects, skip)

<!-- Task logs below - APPEND ONLY -->

## Task - docs-1
- Created .bak snapshots of all 5 AGENTS.md files before regeneration
- Files: AGENTS.md.bak, packages/kumo/AGENTS.md.bak, packages/kumo-docs-astro/AGENTS.md.bak, packages/kumo-figma/AGENTS.md.bak, ci/AGENTS.md.bak
- Verified: md5 checksums match originals, line counts confirmed (131, 129, 95, 105, 90)
- **Learnings:** All AGENTS.md files are in expected locations per root AGENTS.md STRUCTURE section

## Task - docs-2
- Regenerated all 5 AGENTS.md files with corrected counts and current date/commit
- Key fixes: 35→38 components, 37→38 primitives, added 6 workflows section, added `ai` CLI command, 5→6 lint rules, added demo/block/page counts
- Root: 144 lines. Subdirs: 80, 69, 69, 70 lines (all within limits)
- Scoring: evaluated lint/, .github/, kumo/scripts/, _examples/ — none met threshold for new AGENTS.md
- Files changed: AGENTS.md, packages/kumo/AGENTS.md, packages/kumo-docs-astro/AGENTS.md, packages/kumo-figma/AGENTS.md, ci/AGENTS.md
- **Learnings:** Previous root AGENTS.md incorrectly stated "No GitHub Actions workflows checked into repo" — 6 exist at .github/workflows/. ci/AGENTS.md also incorrectly said "No workflow YAML checked in". Both stale claims fixed.
