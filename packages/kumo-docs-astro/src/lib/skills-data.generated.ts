    "content": "This skill guides creation of distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces that avoid generic \"AI slop\" aesthetics. Implement real working code with exceptional attention to aesthetic details and creative choices.\n\nThe user provides frontend requirements: a component, page, application, or interface to build. They may include context about the purpose, audience, or technical constraints.\n\n## Design Thinking\n\nBefore coding, understand the context and commit to a BOLD aesthetic direction:\n\n- **Purpose**: What problem does this interface solve? Who uses it?\n- **Tone**: Pick an extreme: brutally minimal, maximalist chaos, retro-futuristic, organic/natural, luxury/refined, playful/toy-like, editorial/magazine, brutalist/raw, art deco/geometric, soft/pastel, industrial/utilitarian, etc. There are so many flavors to choose from. Use these for inspiration but design one that is true to the aesthetic direction.\n- **Constraints**: Technical requirements (framework, performance, accessibility).\n- **Differentiation**: What makes this UNFORGETTABLE? What's the one thing someone will remember?\n\n**CRITICAL**: Choose a clear conceptual direction and execute it with precision. Bold maximalism and refined minimalism both work - the key is intentionality, not intensity.\n\nThen implement working code (HTML/CSS/JS, React, Vue, etc.) that is:\n\n- Production-grade and functional\n- Visually striking and memorable\n- Cohesive with a clear aesthetic point-of-view\n- Meticulously refined in every detail\n\n## Frontend Aesthetics Guidelines\n\nFocus on:\n\n- **Typography**: Choose fonts that are beautiful, unique, and interesting. Avoid generic fonts like Arial and Inter; opt instead for distinctive choices that elevate the frontend's aesthetics; unexpected, characterful font choices. Pair a distinctive display font with a refined body font.\n- **Color & Theme**: Commit to a cohesive aesthetic. Use CSS variables for consistency. Dominant colors with sharp accents outperform timid, evenly-distributed palettes.\n- **Motion**: Use animations for effects and micro-interactions. Prioritize CSS-only solutions for HTML. Use Motion library for React when available. Focus on high-impact moments: one well-orchestrated page load with staggered reveals (animation-delay) creates more delight than scattered micro-interactions. Use scroll-triggering and hover states that surprise.\n- **Spatial Composition**: Unexpected layouts. Asymmetry. Overlap. Diagonal flow. Grid-breaking elements. Generous negative space OR controlled density.\n- **Backgrounds & Visual Details**: Create atmosphere and depth rather than defaulting to solid colors. Add contextual effects and textures that match the overall aesthetic. Apply creative forms like gradient meshes, noise textures, geometric patterns, layered transparencies, dramatic shadows, decorative borders, custom cursors, and grain overlays.\n\nNEVER use generic AI-generated aesthetics like overused font families (Inter, Roboto, Arial, system fonts), cliched color schemes (particularly purple gradients on white backgrounds), predictable layouts and component patterns, and cookie-cutter design that lacks context-specific character.\n\nInterpret creatively and make unexpected choices that feel genuinely designed for the context. No design should be the same. Vary between light and dark themes, different fonts, different aesthetics. NEVER converge on common choices (Space Grotesk, for example) across generations.\n\n**IMPORTANT**: Match implementation complexity to the aesthetic vision. Maximalist designs need elaborate code with extensive animations and effects. Minimalist or refined designs need restraint, precision, and careful attention to spacing, typography, and subtle details. Elegance comes from executing the vision well.\n\nRemember: Claude is capable of extraordinary creative work. Don't hold back, show what can truly be created when thinking outside the box and committing fully to a distinctive vision."

    "description": "Comprehensive guide for building beautiful, functional web micro-apps. Covers design philosophy, typography, color theory, spatial awareness, interaction design, motion, and component patterns. Use when building polished UI applications with attention to aesthetic detail.",
    "content": "# Spark: Beautiful & Functional Applications Guide\n\n## Design Philosophy\n\nBeautiful web applications transcend mere functionality - they evoke emotion and form memorable experiences. Each app should follow these core principles:\n\n### Foundational Principles\n\n- **Simplicity Through Reduction**: Identify the essential purpose and eliminate everything that distracts from it. Begin with complexity, then deliberately remove until reaching the simplest effective solution.\n- **Material Honesty**: Digital materials have unique properties. Buttons should feel pressable, cards should feel substantial, and animations should reflect real-world physics while embracing digital possibilities.\n- **Obsessive Detail**: Consider every pixel, every interaction, and every transition. Excellence emerges from hundreds of thoughtful decisions that collectively project a feeling of quality.\n- **Coherent Design Language**: Every element should visually communicate its function and feel like part of a unified system. Nothing should feel arbitrary.\n- **Invisibility of Technology**: The best technology disappears. Users should focus on their content and goals, not on understanding your interface.\n- **Start With Why**: Before designing any feature, clearly articulate its purpose and value. This clarity should inform every subsequent decision.\n\n### Typographic Excellence\n\n- **Purposeful Typography**: Typography should be treated as a core design element, not an afterthought. Every typeface choice should serve the app's purpose and personality.\n- **Typographic Hierarchy**: Construct clear visual distinction between different levels of information. Headlines, subheadings, body text, and captions should each have a distinct but harmonious appearance that guides users through content.\n- **Limited Font Selection**: Choose no more than 2-3 typefaces for the entire application. Consider San Francisco, Helvetica Neue, or similarly clean sans-serif fonts that emphasize legibility.\n- **Type Scale Harmony**: Establish a mathematical relationship between text sizes (like the golden ratio or major third). This forms visual rhythm and cohesion across the interface.\n- **Breathing Room**: Allow generous spacing around text elements. Line height should typically be 1.5x font size for body text, with paragraph spacing that forms clear visual separation without disconnection.\n\n### Color Theory Application\n\n- **Intentional Color**: Every color should have a specific purpose. Avoid decorative colors that don't communicate function or hierarchy.\n- **Color as Communication**: Use color to convey meaning - success, warning, information, or action. Maintain consistency in these relationships throughout the app.\n- **Sophisticated Palettes**: Prefer subtle, slightly desaturated colors rather than bold primary colors. Consider colors that feel \"photographed\" rather than \"rendered.\"\n- **Contextual Adaptation**: Colors should respond to their environment. Consider how colors appear how they interact with surrounding elements.\n- **Focus Through Restraint**: Limit accent colors to guide attention to the most important actions. The majority of the interface should use neutral tones that recede and let content shine.\n\n### Spatial Awareness\n\n- **Compositional Balance**: Every screen should feel balanced, with careful attention to visual weight and negative space. Elements should feel purposefully placed rather than arbitrarily positioned.\n- **Grid Discipline**: Maintain a consistent underlying grid system that forms a sense of order while allowing for meaningful exceptions when appropriate.\n- **Breathing Room**: Use generous negative space to focus attention and design a sense of calm. Avoid cluttered interfaces where elements compete for attention.\n- **Spatial Relationships**: Related elements should be visually grouped through proximity, alignment, and shared attributes. The space between elements should communicate their relationship.\n\n## Human Interface Elements\n\n### Core Interaction Principles\n\n- **Direct Manipulation**: Design interfaces where users interact directly with their content rather than through abstract controls. Elements should respond in ways that feel physically intuitive.\n- **Immediate Feedback**: Every interaction must provide instantaneous visual feedback (within 100ms), even if the complete action takes longer to process.\n- **Perceived Continuity**: Maintain context during transitions. Users should always understand where they came from and where they're going.\n- **Consistent Behavior**: Elements that look similar should behave similarly. Build trust through predictable patterns.\n- **Forgiveness**: Make errors difficult, but recovery easy. Provide clear paths to undo actions and recover from mistakes.\n- **Discoverability**: Core functions should be immediately visible. Advanced functions can be progressively revealed as needed.\n\n### Control Design Guidelines\n\n#### Buttons\n\n- **Purpose-Driven Design**: Visually express the importance and function of each button through its appearance. Primary actions should be visually distinct from secondary or tertiary actions.\n- **States**: Every button must have distinct, carefully designed states for:\n  - Default (rest)\n  - Hover\n  - Active/Pressed\n  - Focused\n  - Disabled\n\n- **Visual Affordance**: Buttons should appear \"pressable\" through subtle shadows, highlights, or dimensionality cues that respond to interaction.\n- **Size and Touch Targets**: Minimum touch target size of 44x44px for all interactive elements, regardless of visual size.\n- **Label Clarity**: Use concise, action-oriented verbs that clearly communicate what happens when pressed.\n\n#### Input Controls\n\n- **Form Fields**: Design fields that guide users through correct input with:\n  - Clear labeling that remains visible during input\n  - Smart defaults when possible\n  - Format examples for complex inputs\n  - Inline validation with constructive error messages\n  - Visual confirmation of successful input\n\n- **Selection Controls**: Toggles, checkboxes, and radio buttons should:\n  - Have a clear visual difference between selected and unselected states\n  - Provide generous hit areas beyond the visible control\n  - Group related options visually\n  - Animate state changes to reinforce selection\n\n- **Field Focus**: Highlight the active input with a subtle but distinct focus state. Consider using a combination of color change, subtle animation, and lighting effects.\n\n#### Menus and Lists\n\n- **Hierarchical Organization**: Structure content in a way that communicates relationships clearly.\n- **Progressive Disclosure**: Reveal details as needed rather than overwhelming users with options.\n- **Selection Feedback**: Provide immediate, satisfying feedback when items are selected.\n- **Empty States**: Design thoughtful empty states that guide users toward appropriate actions.\n\n### Motion and Animation\n\n- **Purposeful Animation**: Every animation must serve a functional purpose:\n  - Orient users during navigation changes\n  - Establish relationships between elements\n  - Provide feedback for interactions\n  - Guide attention to important changes\n\n- **Natural Physics**: Movement should follow real-world physics with appropriate:\n  - Acceleration and deceleration\n  - Mass and momentum characteristics\n  - Elasticity appropriate to the context\n\n- **Subtle Restraint**: Animations should be felt rather than seen. Avoid animations that:\n  - Delay user actions unnecessarily\n  - Call attention to themselves\n  - Feel mechanical or artificial\n\n- **Timing Guidelines**:\n  - Quick actions (button press): 100-150ms\n  - State changes: 200-300ms\n  - Page transitions: 300-500ms\n  - Attention-directing: 200-400ms\n\n- **Spatial Consistency**: Maintain a coherent spatial model. Elements that appear to come from off-screen should return in that direction.\n\n### Responsive States and Feedback\n\n- **State Transitions**: Design smooth transitions between all interface states. Nothing should change abruptly without appropriate visual feedback.\n- **Loading States**: Replace generic spinners with purpose-built, branded loading indicators that communicate progress clearly.\n- **Success Confirmation**: Acknowledge completed actions with subtle but clear visual confirmation.\n- **Error Handling**: Present errors with constructive guidance rather than technical details. Errors should never feel like dead ends.\n\n### Gesture and Input Support\n\n- **Precision vs. Convenience**: Design for both precise (mouse, stylus) and convenience (touch, keyboard) inputs, adapting the interface appropriately.\n\n- **Natural Gestures**: Implement common gestures that match user expectations:\n  - Tap for primary actions\n  - Long-press for contextual options\n  - Swipe for navigation or dismissal\n  - Pinch for scaling content\n\n- **Keyboard Navigation**: Ensure complete keyboard accessibility with logical tab order and visible focus states.\n\n### Micro-Interactions\n\n- **Moment of Delight**: Identify key moments in user flows where subtle animations or feedback can form emotional connection.\n- **Reactive Elements**: Design elements that respond subtly to cursor proximity or scroll position, creating a sense of liveliness.\n- **Progressive Enhancement**: Layer micro-interactions so they enhance but never obstruct functionality.\n\n### Finishing Touches\n\n- **Micro-Interactions**: Add small, delightful details that reward attention and form emotional connection. These should be discovered naturally rather than announcing themselves.\n- **Fit and Finish**: Obsess over pixel-perfect execution. Alignment, spacing, and proportions should be mathematically precise and visually harmonious.\n- **Content-Focused Design**: The interface should ultimately serve the content. When content is present, the UI should recede; when guidance is needed, the UI should emerge.\n- **Consistency with Surprise**: Establish consistent patterns that build user confidence, but introduce occasional moments of delight that form memorable experiences.\n\n## PRD Planning Framework\n\nUse this thinking framework when planning new UI projects:\n\n### Core Purpose & Success\n\n- **Mission Statement**: What's the one-sentence purpose of this website?\n- **Success Indicators**: How will we measure if this website achieves its goals?\n- **Experience Qualities**: What three adjectives should define the user experience?\n\n### Project Classification & Approach\n\n- **Complexity Level**: Micro Tool / Content Showcase / Light Application / Complex Application\n- **Primary User Activity**: Consuming, Acting, Creating, or Interacting?\n\n### Feature Selection Thought Process\n\n- **Core Problem Analysis**: What specific problem are we solving?\n- **User Context**: When and how will users engage with this site?\n- **Critical Path**: Map the essential journey from entry to goal completion\n- **Key Moments**: Identify 2-3 pivotal interactions that define the experience\n\n### Design Direction\n\n#### Visual Tone & Identity\n\n- **Emotional Response**: What specific feelings should the design evoke?\n- **Design Personality**: Playful, serious, elegant, rugged, cutting-edge, or classic?\n- **Visual Metaphors**: What imagery or concepts reflect the site's purpose?\n- **Simplicity Spectrum**: Minimal vs. rich - which better serves the core purpose?\n\n#### Color Strategy\n\n- **Color Scheme Type**: Monochromatic / Analogous / Complementary / Triadic / Custom\n- **Primary Color**: Main brand color and what it communicates\n- **Secondary Colors**: Supporting colors and their purposes\n- **Accent Color**: Attention-grabbing highlight for CTAs and important elements\n- **Color Psychology**: How selected colors influence user perception\n- **Foreground/Background Pairings**: Define text color for each background. Validate against WCAG AA (4.5:1 normal, 3:1 large).\n\n#### Typography System\n\n- **Font Pairing Strategy**: How heading and body fonts work together\n- **Typographic Hierarchy**: Size, weight, and spacing relationships\n- **Font Personality**: What characteristics should the typefaces convey?\n- **Readability Focus**: Line length, spacing, and size for optimal reading\n\n#### Visual Hierarchy & Layout\n\n- **Attention Direction**: How design guides the user's eye to important elements\n- **White Space Philosophy**: How negative space creates rhythm and focus\n- **Grid System**: Underlying structure for organizing content\n- **Responsive Approach**: How the design adapts across device sizes\n- **Content Density**: Balancing information richness with visual clarity\n\n#### Animations\n\n- **Purposeful Meaning**: How motion communicates brand personality and guides attention\n- **Hierarchy of Movement**: Which elements deserve animation focus based on importance\n- **Contextual Appropriateness**: Balance between subtle functionality and moments of delight\n\n#### UI Elements & Components\n\n- **Component Usage**: Which components best serve each function\n- **Component Customization**: Modifications needed for brand alignment\n- **Component States**: How interactive elements behave in different states\n- **Icon Selection**: Which icons best represent each action or concept\n- **Spacing System**: Consistent padding and margin values\n- **Mobile Adaptation**: How components reconfigure on smaller screens\n\n### Edge Cases & Problem Scenarios\n\n- **Potential Obstacles**: What might prevent users from succeeding?\n- **Edge Case Handling**: How will the site handle unexpected user behaviors?\n- **Technical Constraints**: What limitations should we be aware of?\n\n### Reflection\n\n- What makes this approach uniquely suited to this particular need?\n- What assumptions have we made that should be challenged?\n- What would make this solution truly exceptional?"

    "content": "# High-Agency Frontend Skill\n\n## 1. ACTIVE BASELINE CONFIGURATION\n\n- DESIGN_VARIANCE: 8 (1=Perfect Symmetry, 10=Artsy Chaos)\n- MOTION_INTENSITY: 6 (1=Static/No movement, 10=Cinematic/Magic Physics)\n- VISUAL_DENSITY: 4 (1=Art Gallery/Airy, 10=Pilot Cockpit/Packed Data)\n\n**AI Instruction:** The standard baseline for all generations is strictly set to these values (8, 6, 4). Do not ask the user to edit this file. Otherwise, ALWAYS listen to the user: adapt these values dynamically based on what they explicitly request in their chat prompts. Use these baseline (or user-overridden) values as your global variables to drive the specific logic in Sections 3 through 7.\n\n## 2. DEFAULT ARCHITECTURE & CONVENTIONS\n\nUnless the user explicitly specifies a different stack, adhere to these structural constraints to maintain consistency:\n\n- **DEPENDENCY VERIFICATION [MANDATORY]:** Before importing ANY 3rd party library (e.g. `framer-motion`, `lucide-react`, `zustand`), you MUST check `package.json`. If the package is missing, you MUST output the installation command (e.g. `npm install package-name`) before providing the code. **Never** assume a library exists.\n- **Framework & Interactivity:** React or Next.js. Default to Server Components (`RSC`).\n  - **RSC SAFETY:** Global state works ONLY in Client Components. In Next.js, wrap providers in a `\"use client\"` component.\n  - **INTERACTIVITY ISOLATION:** If Sections 4 or 7 (Motion/Liquid Glass) are active, the specific interactive UI component MUST be extracted as an isolated leaf component with `'use client'` at the very top. Server Components must exclusively render static layouts.\n- **State Management:** Use local `useState`/`useReducer` for isolated UI. Use global state strictly for deep prop-drilling avoidance.\n- **Styling Policy:** Use Tailwind CSS (v3/v4) for 90% of styling.\n  - **TAILWIND VERSION LOCK:** Check `package.json` first. Do not use v4 syntax in v3 projects.\n  - **T4 CONFIG GUARD:** For v4, do NOT use `tailwindcss` plugin in `postcss.config.js`. Use `@tailwindcss/postcss` or the Vite plugin.\n- **ANTI-EMOJI POLICY [CRITICAL]:** NEVER use emojis in code, markup, text content, or alt text. Replace symbols with high-quality icons (Radix, Phosphor) or clean SVG primitives. Emojis are BANNED.\n- **Responsiveness & Spacing:**\n  - Standardize breakpoints (`sm`, `md`, `lg`, `xl`).\n  - Contain page layouts using `max-w-[1400px] mx-auto` or `max-w-7xl`.\n  - **Viewport Stability [CRITICAL]:** NEVER use `h-screen` for full-height Hero sections. ALWAYS use `min-h-[100dvh]` to prevent catastrophic layout jumping on mobile browsers (iOS Safari).\n  - **Grid over Flex-Math:** NEVER use complex flexbox percentage math (`w-[calc(33%-1rem)]`). ALWAYS use CSS Grid (`grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-3 gap-6`) for reliable structures.\n- **Icons:** You MUST use exactly `@phosphor-icons/react` or `@radix-ui/react-icons` as the import paths (check installed version). Standardize `strokeWidth` globally (e.g., exclusively use `1.5` or `2.0`).\n\n## 3. DESIGN ENGINEERING DIRECTIVES (Bias Correction)\n\nLLMs have statistical biases toward specific UI cliche patterns. Proactively construct premium interfaces using these engineered rules:\n\n**Rule 1: Deterministic Typography**\n\n- **Display/Headlines:** Default to `text-4xl md:text-6xl tracking-tighter leading-none`.\n  - **ANTI-SLOP:** Discourage `Inter` for \"Premium\" or \"Creative\" vibes. Force unique character using `Geist`, `Outfit`, `Cabinet Grotesk`, or `Satoshi`.\n  - **TECHNICAL UI RULE:** Serif fonts are strictly BANNED for Dashboard/Software UIs. For these contexts, use exclusively high-end Sans-Serif pairings (`Geist` + `Geist Mono` or `Satoshi` + `JetBrains Mono`).\n- **Body/Paragraphs:** Default to `text-base text-gray-600 leading-relaxed max-w-[65ch]`.\n\n**Rule 2: Color Calibration**\n\n- **Constraint:** Max 1 Accent Color. Saturation < 80%.\n- **THE LILA BAN:** The \"AI Purple/Blue\" aesthetic is strictly BANNED. No purple button glows, no neon gradients. Use absolute neutral bases (Zinc/Slate) with high-contrast, singular accents (e.g. Emerald, Electric Blue, or Deep Rose).\n- **COLOR CONSISTENCY:** Stick to one palette for the entire output. Do not fluctuate between warm and cool grays within the same project.\n\n**Rule 3: Layout Diversification**\n\n- **ANTI-CENTER BIAS:** Centered Hero/H1 sections are strictly BANNED when `LAYOUT_VARIANCE > 4`. Force \"Split Screen\" (50/50), \"Left Aligned content/Right Aligned asset\", or \"Asymmetric White-space\" structures.\n\n**Rule 4: Materiality, Shadows, and \"Anti-Card Overuse\"**\n\n- **DASHBOARD HARDENING:** For `VISUAL_DENSITY > 7`, generic card containers are strictly BANNED. Use logic-grouping via `border-t`, `divide-y`, or purely negative space. Data metrics should breathe without being boxed in unless elevation (z-index) is functionally required.\n- **Execution:** Use cards ONLY when elevation communicates hierarchy. When a shadow is used, tint it to the background hue.\n\n**Rule 5: Interactive UI States**\n\n- **Mandatory Generation:** LLMs naturally generate \"static\" successful states. You MUST implement full interaction cycles:\n  - **Loading:** Skeletal loaders matching layout sizes (avoid generic circular spinners).\n  - **Empty States:** Beautifully composed empty states indicating how to populate data.\n  - **Error States:** Clear, inline error reporting (e.g., forms).\n  - **Tactile Feedback:** On `:active`, use `-translate-y-[1px]` or `scale-[0.98]` to simulate a physical push indicating success/action.\n\n**Rule 6: Data & Form Patterns**\n\n- **Forms:** Label MUST sit above input. Helper text is optional but should exist in markup. Error text below input. Use a standard `gap-2` for input blocks.\n\n## 4. CREATIVE PROACTIVITY (Anti-Slop Implementation)\n\nTo actively combat generic AI designs, systematically implement these high-end coding concepts as your baseline:\n\n- **\"Liquid Glass\" Refraction:** When glassmorphism is needed, go beyond `backdrop-blur`. Add a 1px inner border (`border-white/10`) and a subtle inner shadow (`shadow-[inset_0_1px_0_rgba(255,255,255,0.1)]`) to simulate physical edge refraction.\n- **Magnetic Micro-physics (If MOTION_INTENSITY > 5):** Implement buttons that pull slightly toward the mouse cursor. **CRITICAL:** NEVER use React `useState` for magnetic hover or continuous animations. Use EXCLUSIVELY Framer Motion's `useMotionValue` and `useTransform` outside the React render cycle to prevent performance collapse on mobile.\n- **Perpetual Micro-Interactions:** When `MOTION_INTENSITY > 5`, embed continuous, infinite micro-animations (Pulse, Typewriter, Float, Shimmer, Carousel) in standard components (avatars, status dots, backgrounds). Apply premium Spring Physics (`type: \"spring\", stiffness: 100, damping: 20`) to all interactive elements—no linear easing.\n- **Layout Transitions:** Always utilize Framer Motion's `layout` and `layoutId` props for smooth re-ordering, resizing, and shared element transitions across state changes.\n- **Staggered Orchestration:** Do not mount lists or grids instantly. Use `staggerChildren` (Framer) or CSS cascade (`animation-delay: calc(var(--index) * 100ms)`) to create sequential waterfall reveals. **CRITICAL:** For `staggerChildren`, the Parent (`variants`) and Children MUST reside in the identical Client Component tree. If data is fetched asynchronously, pass the data as props into a centralized Parent Motion wrapper.\n\n## 5. PERFORMANCE GUARDRAILS\n\n- **DOM Cost:** Apply grain/noise filters exclusively to fixed, pointer-event-none pseudo-elements (e.g., `fixed inset-0 z-50 pointer-events-none`) and NEVER to scrolling containers to prevent continuous GPU repaints and mobile performance degradation.\n- **Hardware Acceleration:** Never animate `top`, `left`, `width`, or `height`. Animate exclusively via `transform` and `opacity`.\n- **Z-Index Restraint:** NEVER spam arbitrary `z-50` or `z-10` unprompted. Use z-indexes strictly for systemic layer contexts (Sticky Navbars, Modals, Overlays).\n\n## 6. TECHNICAL REFERENCE (Dial Definitions)\n\n### DESIGN_VARIANCE (Level 1-10)\n\n- **1-3 (Predictable):** Flexbox `justify-center`, strict 12-column symmetrical grids, equal paddings.\n- **4-7 (Offset):** Use `margin-top: -2rem` overlapping, varied image aspect ratios (e.g., 4:3 next to 16:9), left-aligned headers over center-aligned data.\n- **8-10 (Asymmetric):** Masonry layouts, CSS Grid with fractional units (e.g., `grid-template-columns: 2fr 1fr 1fr`), massive empty zones (`padding-left: 20vw`).\n- **MOBILE OVERRIDE:** For levels 4-10, any asymmetric layout above `md:` MUST aggressively fall back to a strict, single-column layout (`w-full`, `px-4`, `py-8`) on viewports `< 768px` to prevent horizontal scrolling and layout breakage.\n\n### MOTION_INTENSITY (Level 1-10)\n\n- **1-3 (Static):** No automatic animations. CSS `:hover` and `:active` states only.\n- **4-7 (Fluid CSS):** Use `transition: all 0.3s cubic-bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1)`. Use `animation-delay` cascades for load-ins. Focus strictly on `transform` and `opacity`. Use `will-change: transform` sparingly.\n- **8-10 (Advanced Choreography):** Complex scroll-triggered reveals or parallax. Use Framer Motion hooks. NEVER use `window.addEventListener('scroll')`.\n\n### VISUAL_DENSITY (Level 1-10)\n\n- **1-3 (Art Gallery Mode):** Lots of white space. Huge section gaps. Everything feels very expensive and clean.\n- **4-7 (Daily App Mode):** Normal spacing for standard web apps.\n- **8-10 (Cockpit Mode):** Tiny paddings. No card boxes; just 1px lines to separate data. Everything is packed. **Mandatory:** Use Monospace (`font-mono`) for all numbers.\n\n## 7. THE 100 AI TELLS (Forbidden Patterns)\n\nTo guarantee a premium, non-generic output, you MUST strictly avoid these common AI design signatures unless explicitly requested:\n\n### Visual & CSS\n\n- **NO Neon/Outer Glows:** Do not use default `box-shadow` glows or auto-glows. Use inner borders or subtle tinted shadows.\n- **NO Pure Black:** Never use `#000000`. Use Off-Black, Zinc-950, or Charcoal.\n- **NO Oversaturated Accents:** Desaturate accents to blend elegantly with neutrals.\n- **NO Excessive Gradient Text:** Do not use text-fill gradients for large headers.\n- **NO Custom Mouse Cursors:** They are outdated and ruin performance/accessibility.\n\n### Typography\n\n- **NO Inter Font:** Banned. Use `Geist`, `Outfit`, `Cabinet Grotesk`, or `Satoshi`.\n- **NO Oversized H1s:** The first heading should not scream. Control hierarchy with weight and color, not just massive scale.\n- **Serif Constraints:** Use Serif fonts ONLY for creative/editorial designs. **NEVER** use Serif on clean Dashboards.\n\n### Layout & Spacing\n\n- **Align & Space Perfectly:** Ensure padding and margins are mathematically perfect. Avoid floating elements with awkward gaps.\n- **NO 3-Column Card Layouts:** The generic \"3 equal cards horizontally\" feature row is BANNED. Use a 2-column Zig-Zag, asymmetric grid, or horizontal scrolling approach instead.\n\n### Content & Data (The \"Jane Doe\" Effect)\n\n- **NO Generic Names:** \"John Doe\", \"Sarah Chan\", or \"Jack Su\" are banned. Use highly creative, realistic-sounding names.\n- **NO Generic Avatars:** DO NOT use standard SVG \"egg\" or Lucide user icons for avatars. Use creative, believable photo placeholders or specific styling.\n- **NO Fake Numbers:** Avoid predictable outputs like `99.99%`, `50%`, or basic phone numbers (`1234567`). Use organic, messy data (`47.2%`, `+1 (312) 847-1928`).\n- **NO Startup Slop Names:** \"Acme\", \"Nexus\", \"SmartFlow\". Invent premium, contextual brand names.\n- **NO Filler Words:** Avoid AI copywriting cliches like \"Elevate\", \"Seamless\", \"Unleash\", or \"Next-Gen\". Use concrete verbs.\n\n### External Resources & Components\n\n- **NO Broken Unsplash Links:** Do not use Unsplash. Use absolute, reliable placeholders like `https://picsum.photos/seed/{random_string}/800/600` or SVG UI Avatars.\n- **shadcn/ui Customization:** You may use `shadcn/ui`, but NEVER in its generic default state. You MUST customize the radii, colors, and shadows to match the high-end project aesthetic.\n- **Production-Ready Cleanliness:** Code must be extremely clean, visually striking, memorable, and meticulously refined in every detail.\n\n## 8. THE CREATIVE ARSENAL (High-End Inspiration)\n\nDo not default to generic UI. Pull from this library of advanced concepts to ensure the output is visually striking and memorable. When appropriate, leverage **GSAP (ScrollTrigger/Parallax)** for complex scrolltelling or **ThreeJS/WebGL** for 3D/Canvas animations, rather than basic CSS motion. **CRITICAL:** Never mix GSAP/ThreeJS with Framer Motion in the same component tree. Default to Framer Motion for UI/Bento interactions. Use GSAP/ThreeJS EXCLUSIVELY for isolated full-page scrolltelling or canvas backgrounds, wrapped in strict useEffect cleanup blocks.\n\n### The Standard Hero Paradigm\n\n- Stop doing centered text over a dark image. Try asymmetric Hero sections: Text cleanly aligned to the left or right. The background should feature a high-quality, relevant image with a subtle stylistic fade (darkening or lightening gracefully into the background color depending on if it is Light or Dark mode).\n\n### Navigation & Menus\n\n- **Mac OS Dock Magnification:** Nav-bar at the edge; icons scale fluidly on hover.\n- **Magnetic Button:** Buttons that physically pull toward the cursor.\n- **Gooey Menu:** Sub-items detach from the main button like a viscous liquid.\n- **Dynamic Island:** A pill-shaped UI component that morphs to show status/alerts.\n- **Contextual Radial Menu:** A circular menu expanding exactly at the click coordinates.\n- **Floating Speed Dial:** A FAB that springs out into a curved line of secondary actions.\n- **Mega Menu Reveal:** Full-screen dropdowns that stagger-fade complex content.\n\n### Layout & Grids\n\n- **Bento Grid:** Asymmetric, tile-based grouping (e.g., Apple Control Center).\n- **Masonry Layout:** Staggered grid without fixed row heights (e.g., Pinterest).\n- **Chroma Grid:** Grid borders or tiles showing subtle, continuously animating color gradients.\n- **Split Screen Scroll:** Two screen halves sliding in opposite directions on scroll.\n- **Curtain Reveal:** A Hero section parting in the middle like a curtain on scroll.\n\n### Cards & Containers\n\n- **Parallax Tilt Card:** A 3D-tilting card tracking the mouse coordinates.\n- **Spotlight Border Card:** Card borders that illuminate dynamically under the cursor.\n- **Glassmorphism Panel:** True frosted glass with inner refraction borders.\n- **Holographic Foil Card:** Iridescent, rainbow light reflections shifting on hover.\n- **Tinder Swipe Stack:** A physical stack of cards the user can swipe away.\n- **Morphing Modal:** A button that seamlessly expands into its own full-screen dialog container.\n\n### Scroll-Animations\n\n- **Sticky Scroll Stack:** Cards that stick to the top and physically stack over each other.\n- **Horizontal Scroll Hijack:** Vertical scroll translates into a smooth horizontal gallery pan.\n- **Locomotive Scroll Sequence:** Video/3D sequences where framerate is tied directly to the scrollbar.\n- **Zoom Parallax:** A central background image zooming in/out seamlessly as you scroll.\n- **Scroll Progress Path:** SVG vector lines or routes that draw themselves as the user scrolls.\n- **Liquid Swipe Transition:** Page transitions that wipe the screen like a viscous liquid.\n\n### Galleries & Media\n\n- **Dome Gallery:** A 3D gallery feeling like a panoramic dome.\n- **Coverflow Carousel:** 3D carousel with the center focused and edges angled back.\n- **Drag-to-Pan Grid:** A boundless grid you can freely drag in any compass direction.\n- **Accordion Image Slider:** Narrow vertical/horizontal image strips that expand fully on hover.\n- **Hover Image Trail:** The mouse leaves a trail of popping/fading images behind it.\n- **Glitch Effect Image:** Brief RGB-channel shifting digital distortion on hover.\n\n### Typography & Text\n\n- **Kinetic Marquee:** Endless text bands that reverse direction or speed up on scroll.\n- **Text Mask Reveal:** Massive typography acting as a transparent window to a video background.\n- **Text Scramble Effect:** Matrix-style character decoding on load or hover.\n- **Circular Text Path:** Text curved along a spinning circular path.\n- **Gradient Stroke Animation:** Outlined text with a gradient continuously running along the stroke.\n- **Kinetic Typography Grid:** A grid of letters dodging or rotating away from the cursor.\n\n### Micro-Interactions & Effects\n\n- **Particle Explosion Button:** CTAs that shatter into particles upon success.\n- **Liquid Pull-to-Refresh:** Mobile reload indicators acting like detaching water droplets.\n- **Skeleton Shimmer:** Shifting light reflections moving across placeholder boxes.\n- **Directional Hover Aware Button:** Hover fill entering from the exact side the mouse entered.\n- **Ripple Click Effect:** Visual waves rippling precisely from the click coordinates.\n- **Animated SVG Line Drawing:** Vectors that draw their own contours in real-time.\n- **Mesh Gradient Background:** Organic, lava-lamp-like animated color blobs.\n- **Lens Blur Depth:** Dynamic focus blurring background UI layers to highlight a foreground action.\n\n## 9. THE \"MOTION-ENGINE\" BENTO PARADIGM\n\nWhen generating modern SaaS dashboards or feature sections, you MUST utilize the following \"Bento 2.0\" architecture and motion philosophy. This goes beyond static cards and enforces a \"Vercel-core meets Dribbble-clean\" aesthetic heavily reliant on perpetual physics.\n\n### A. Core Design Philosophy\n\n- **Aesthetic:** High-end, minimal, and functional.\n- **Palette:** Background in `#f9fafb`. Cards are pure white (`#ffffff`) with a 1px border of `border-slate-200/50`.\n- **Surfaces:** Use `rounded-[2.5rem]` for all major containers. Apply a \"diffusion shadow\" (a very light, wide-spreading shadow, e.g., `shadow-[0_20px_40px_-15px_rgba(0,0,0,0.05)]`) to create depth without clutter.\n- **Typography:** Strict `Geist`, `Satoshi`, or `Cabinet Grotesk` font stack. Use subtle tracking (`tracking-tight`) for headers.\n- **Labels:** Titles and descriptions must be placed **outside and below** the cards to maintain a clean, gallery-style presentation.\n- **Pixel-Perfection:** Use generous `p-8` or `p-10` padding inside cards.\n\n### B. The Animation Engine Specs (Perpetual Motion)\n\nAll cards must contain **\"Perpetual Micro-Interactions.\"** Use the following Framer Motion principles:\n\n- **Spring Physics:** No linear easing. Use `type: \"spring\", stiffness: 100, damping: 20` for a premium, weighty feel.\n- **Layout Transitions:** Heavily utilize the `layout` and `layoutId` props to ensure smooth re-ordering, resizing, and shared element state transitions.\n- **Infinite Loops:** Every card must have an \"Active State\" that loops infinitely (Pulse, Typewriter, Float, or Carousel) to ensure the dashboard feels \"alive\".\n- **Performance:** Wrap dynamic lists in `<AnimatePresence>` and optimize for 60fps. **PERFORMANCE CRITICAL:** Any perpetual motion or infinite loop MUST be memoized (React.memo) and completely isolated in its own microscopic Client Component. Never trigger re-renders in the parent layout.\n\n### C. The 5-Card Archetypes (Micro-Animation Specs)\n\nImplement these specific micro-animations when constructing Bento grids (e.g., Row 1: 3 cols | Row 2: 2 cols split 70/30):\n\n1. **The Intelligent List:** A vertical stack of items with an infinite auto-sorting loop. Items swap positions using `layoutId`, simulating an AI prioritizing tasks in real-time.\n2. **The Command Input:** A search/AI bar with a multi-step Typewriter Effect. It cycles through complex prompts, including a blinking cursor and a \"processing\" state with a shimmering loading gradient.\n3. **The Live Status:** A scheduling interface with \"breathing\" status indicators. Include a pop-up notification badge that emerges with an \"Overshoot\" spring effect, stays for 3 seconds, and vanishes.\n4. **The Wide Data Stream:** A horizontal \"Infinite Carousel\" of data cards or metrics. Ensure the loop is seamless (using `x: [\"0%\", \"-100%\"]`) with a speed that feels effortless.\n5. **The Contextual UI (Focus Mode):** A document view that animates a staggered highlight of a text block, followed by a \"Float-in\" of a floating action toolbar with micro-icons.\n\n## 10. FINAL PRE-FLIGHT CHECK\n\nEvaluate your code against this matrix before outputting. This is the **last** filter you apply to your logic.\n\n- [ ] Is global state used appropriately to avoid deep prop-drilling rather than arbitrarily?\n- [ ] Is mobile layout collapse (`w-full`, `px-4`, `max-w-7xl mx-auto`) guaranteed for high-variance designs?\n- [ ] Do full-height sections safely use `min-h-[100dvh]` instead of the bugged `h-screen`?\n- [ ] Do `useEffect` animations contain strict cleanup functions?\n- [ ] Are empty, loading, and error states provided?\n- [ ] Are cards omitted in favor of spacing where possible?\n- [ ] Did you strictly isolate CPU-heavy perpetual animations in their own Client Components?"

    "description": "Create beautiful visual art in .png and .pdf documents using design philosophy. You should use this skill when the user asks to create a poster, piece of art, design, or other static piece. Create original visual designs, never copying existing artists' work to avoid copyright violations.",
    "content": "These are instructions for creating design philosophies - aesthetic movements that are then EXPRESSED VISUALLY. Output only .md files, .pdf files, and .png files.\n\nComplete this in two steps:\n1. Design Philosophy Creation (.md file)\n2. Express by creating it on a canvas (.pdf file or .png file)\n\nFirst, undertake this task:\n\n## DESIGN PHILOSOPHY CREATION\n\nTo begin, create a VISUAL PHILOSOPHY (not layouts or templates) that will be interpreted through:\n- Form, space, color, composition\n- Images, graphics, shapes, patterns\n- Minimal text as visual accent\n\n### THE CRITICAL UNDERSTANDING\n- What is received: Some subtle input or instructions by the user that should be taken into account, but used as a foundation; it should not constrain creative freedom.\n- What is created: A design philosophy/aesthetic movement.\n- What happens next: Then, the same version receives the philosophy and EXPRESSES IT VISUALLY - creating artifacts that are 90% visual design, 10% essential text.\n\nConsider this approach:\n- Write a manifesto for an art movement\n- The next phase involves making the artwork\n\nThe philosophy must emphasize: Visual expression. Spatial communication. Artistic interpretation. Minimal words.\n\n### HOW TO GENERATE A VISUAL PHILOSOPHY\n\n**Name the movement** (1-2 words): \"Brutalist Joy\" / \"Chromatic Silence\" / \"Metabolist Dreams\"\n\n**Articulate the philosophy** (4-6 paragraphs - concise but complete):\n\nTo capture the VISUAL essence, express how the philosophy manifests through:\n- Space and form\n- Color and material\n- Scale and rhythm\n- Composition and balance\n- Visual hierarchy\n\n**CRITICAL GUIDELINES:**\n- **Avoid redundancy**: Each design aspect should be mentioned once. Avoid repeating points about color theory, spatial relationships, or typographic principles unless adding new depth.\n- **Emphasize craftsmanship REPEATEDLY**: The philosophy MUST stress multiple times that the final work should appear as though it took countless hours to create, was labored over with care, and comes from someone at the absolute top of their field. This framing is essential - repeat phrases like \"meticulously crafted,\" \"the product of deep expertise,\" \"painstaking attention,\" \"master-level execution.\"\n- **Leave creative space**: Remain specific about the aesthetic direction, but concise enough that the next Claude has room to make interpretive choices also at a extremely high level of craftmanship.\n\nThe philosophy must guide the next version to express ideas VISUALLY, not through text. Information lives in design, not paragraphs.\n\n### PHILOSOPHY EXAMPLES\n\n**\"Concrete Poetry\"**\nPhilosophy: Communication through monumental form and bold geometry.\nVisual expression: Massive color blocks, sculptural typography (huge single words, tiny labels), Brutalist spatial divisions, Polish poster energy meets Le Corbusier. Ideas expressed through visual weight and spatial tension, not explanation. Text as rare, powerful gesture - never paragraphs, only essential words integrated into the visual architecture. Every element placed with the precision of a master craftsman.\n\n**\"Chromatic Language\"**\nPhilosophy: Color as the primary information system.\nVisual expression: Geometric precision where color zones create meaning. Typography minimal - small sans-serif labels letting chromatic fields communicate. Think Josef Albers' interaction meets data visualization. Information encoded spatially and chromatically. Words only to anchor what color already shows. The result of painstaking chromatic calibration.\n\n**\"Analog Meditation\"**\nPhilosophy: Quiet visual contemplation through texture and breathing room.\nVisual expression: Paper grain, ink bleeds, vast negative space. Photography and illustration dominate. Typography whispered (small, restrained, serving the visual). Japanese photobook aesthetic. Images breathe across pages. Text appears sparingly - short phrases, never explanatory blocks. Each composition balanced with the care of a meditation practice.\n\n**\"Organic Systems\"**\nPhilosophy: Natural clustering and modular growth patterns.\nVisual expression: Rounded forms, organic arrangements, color from nature through architecture. Information shown through visual diagrams, spatial relationships, iconography. Text only for key labels floating in space. The composition tells the story through expert spatial orchestration.\n\n**\"Geometric Silence\"**\nPhilosophy: Pure order and restraint.\nVisual expression: Grid-based precision, bold photography or stark graphics, dramatic negative space. Typography precise but minimal - small essential text, large quiet zones. Swiss formalism meets Brutalist material honesty. Structure communicates, not words. Every alignment the work of countless refinements.\n\n*These are condensed examples. The actual design philosophy should be 4-6 substantial paragraphs.*\n\n### ESSENTIAL PRINCIPLES\n- **VISUAL PHILOSOPHY**: Create an aesthetic worldview to be expressed through design\n- **MINIMAL TEXT**: Always emphasize that text is sparse, essential-only, integrated as visual element - never lengthy\n- **SPATIAL EXPRESSION**: Ideas communicate through space, form, color, composition - not paragraphs\n- **ARTISTIC FREEDOM**: The next Claude interprets the philosophy visually - provide creative room\n- **PURE DESIGN**: This is about making ART OBJECTS, not documents with decoration\n- **EXPERT CRAFTSMANSHIP**: Repeatedly emphasize the final work must look meticulously crafted, labored over with care, the product of countless hours by someone at the top of their field\n\n**The design philosophy should be 4-6 paragraphs long.** Fill it with poetic design philosophy that brings together the core vision. Avoid repeating the same points. Keep the design philosophy generic without mentioning the intention of the art, as if it can be used wherever. Output the design philosophy as a .md file.\n\n---\n\n## DEDUCING THE SUBTLE REFERENCE\n\n**CRITICAL STEP**: Before creating the canvas, identify the subtle conceptual thread from the original request.\n\n**THE ESSENTIAL PRINCIPLE**:\nThe topic is a **subtle, niche reference embedded within the art itself** - not always literal, always sophisticated. Someone familiar with the subject should feel it intuitively, while others simply experience a masterful abstract composition. The design philosophy provides the aesthetic language. The deduced topic provides the soul - the quiet conceptual DNA woven invisibly into form, color, and composition.\n\nThis is **VERY IMPORTANT**: The reference must be refined so it enhances the work's depth without announcing itself. Think like a jazz musician quoting another song - only those who know will catch it, but everyone appreciates the music.\n\n---\n\n## CANVAS CREATION\n\nWith both the philosophy and the conceptual framework established, express it on a canvas. Take a moment to gather thoughts and clear the mind. Use the design philosophy created and the instructions below to craft a masterpiece, embodying all aspects of the philosophy with expert craftsmanship.\n\n**IMPORTANT**: For any type of content, even if the user requests something for a movie/game/book, the approach should still be sophisticated. Never lose sight of the idea that this should be art, not something that's cartoony or amateur.\n\nTo create museum or magazine quality work, use the design philosophy as the foundation. Create one single page, highly visual, design-forward PDF or PNG output (unless asked for more pages). Generally use repeating patterns and perfect shapes. Treat the abstract philosophical design as if it were a scientific bible, borrowing the visual language of systematic observation—dense accumulation of marks, repeated elements, or layered patterns that build meaning through patient repetition and reward sustained viewing. Add sparse, clinical typography and systematic reference markers that suggest this could be a diagram from an imaginary discipline, treating the invisible subject with the same reverence typically reserved for documenting observable phenomena. Anchor the piece with simple phrase(s) or details positioned subtly, using a limited color palette that feels intentional and cohesive. Embrace the paradox of using analytical visual language to express ideas about human experience: the result should feel like an artifact that proves something ephemeral can be studied, mapped, and understood through careful attention. This is true art. \n\n**Text as a contextual element**: Text is always minimal and visual-first, but let context guide whether that means whisper-quiet labels or bold typographic gestures. A punk venue poster might have larger, more aggressive type than a minimalist ceramics studio identity. Most of the time, font should be thin. All use of fonts must be design-forward and prioritize visual communication. Regardless of text scale, nothing falls off the page and nothing overlaps. Every element must be contained within the canvas boundaries with proper margins. Check carefully that all text, graphics, and visual elements have breathing room and clear separation. This is non-negotiable for professional execution. **IMPORTANT: Use different fonts if writing text. Search the `./canvas-fonts` directory. Regardless of approach, sophistication is non-negotiable.**\n\nDownload and use whatever fonts are needed to make this a reality. Get creative by making the typography actually part of the art itself -- if the art is abstract, bring the font onto the canvas, not typeset digitally.\n\nTo push boundaries, follow design instinct/intuition while using the philosophy as a guiding principle. Embrace ultimate design freedom and choice. Push aesthetics and design to the frontier. \n\n**CRITICAL**: To achieve human-crafted quality (not AI-generated), create work that looks like it took countless hours. Make it appear as though someone at the absolute top of their field labored over every detail with painstaking care. Ensure the composition, spacing, color choices, typography - everything screams expert-level craftsmanship. Double-check that nothing overlaps, formatting is flawless, every detail perfect. Create something that could be shown to people to prove expertise and rank as undeniably impressive.\n\nOutput the final result as a single, downloadable .pdf or .png file, alongside the design philosophy used as a .md file.\n\n---\n\n## FINAL STEP\n\n**IMPORTANT**: The user ALREADY said \"It isn't perfect enough. It must be pristine, a masterpiece if craftsmanship, as if it were about to be displayed in a museum.\"\n\n**CRITICAL**: To refine the work, avoid adding more graphics; instead refine what has been created and make it extremely crisp, respecting the design philosophy and the principles of minimalism entirely. Rather than adding a fun filter or refactoring a font, consider how to make the existing composition more cohesive with the art. If the instinct is to call a new function or draw a new shape, STOP and instead ask: \"How can I make what's already here more of a piece of art?\"\n\nTake a second pass. Go back to the code and refine/polish further to make this a philosophically designed masterpiece.\n\n## MULTI-PAGE OPTION\n\nTo create additional pages when requested, create more creative pages along the same lines as the design philosophy but distinctly different as well. Bundle those pages in the same .pdf or many .pngs. Treat the first page as just a single page in a whole coffee table book waiting to be filled. Make the next pages unique twists and memories of the original. Have them almost tell a story in a very tasteful way. Exercise full creative freedom."

Extract visual language from the project:**\n\n**If Tailwind detected**, read `tailwind.config.js` or `tailwind.config.ts`:\n```javascript\n// Extract and use:\ntheme.colors      // Color palette\ntheme.spacing     // Spacing scale\ntheme.borderRadius // Radius values\ntheme.fontFamily  // Typography\ntheme.boxShadow   // Elevation system\n```\n\n**If CSS Variables exist**, read `globals.css`, `variables.css`, or `:root` definitions:\n```css\n:root {\n  --color-*     /* Color tokens */\n  --spacing-*   /* Spacing tokens */\n  --font-*      /* Typography tokens */\n  --radius-*    /* Border radius tokens */\n}\n```\n\n**If UI library detected** (MUI, Chakra, Ant), read the theme configuration:\n- MUI: `theme.ts` or `createTheme()` call\n- Chakra: `theme/index.ts` or `extendTheme()` call\n- Ant: `ConfigProvider` theme prop\n\n**Always scan existing components** to understand patterns:\n- Find 2-3 existing buttons → note their styling patterns\n- Find 2-3 existing cards → note padding, borders, shadows\n- Find existing forms → note input styles, label placement\n- Find existing typography → note heading sizes, body text\n\n**Store inferred styles in the Design Brief** for consistent use across all variants.\n\n---\n\n## Phase 1: Interview\n\nUse the **AskUserQuestion** tool for all interview steps. Adapt questions based on Design Memory if it exists.\n\n### Step 1.1: Scope & Target\n\nAsk these questions (can combine into single AskUserQuestion with multiple questions):\n\n**Question 1: Scope**\n- Header: \"Scope\"\n- Question: \"Are we designing a single component or a full page?\"\n- Options:\n  -

No special constraints\n- multiSelect: true\n\n---\n\n## Phase 2: Generate Design Brief\n\nAfter the interview, create a structured Design Brief as JSON and save to `.claude-design/design-brief.json`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"scope\": \"component|page\",\n  \"isRedesign\": true|false,\n  \"targetPath\": \"src/components/Example.tsx\",\n  \"targetName\": \"Example\",\n  \"painPoints\": [\"Too dense\", \"Primary action unclear\"],\n  \"inspiration\": {\n    \"visual\": [\"Stripe\", \"Linear\"],\n    \"functional\": [\"Inline validation\"]\n  },\n  \"brand\": {\n    \"adjectives\": [\"minimal\", \"trustworthy\"],\n    \"density\": \"comfortable\",\n    \"darkMode\": true\n  },\n  \"persona\": {\n    \"primary\": \"Developer\",\n    \"context\": \"desktop-first\",\n    \"keyTasks\": [\"Complete checkout\", \"Review order\", \"Apply discount\"]\n  },\n  \"constraints\": {\n    \"mustKeep\": [\"existing fields\"],\n    \"technical\": [\"no new dependencies\", \"WCAG accessible\"]\n  },\n  \"framework\": \"nextjs-app\",\n  \"packageManager\": \"pnpm\",\n  \"stylingSystem\": \"tailwind\"\n}\n```\n\nDisplay a summary to the user before proceeding.\n\n---\n\n## Phase 3: Generate Design Lab\n\n### Directory Structure\n\nCreate all files under `.claude-design/`:\n\n```\n.claude-design/\n├── lab/\n│   ├── page.tsx                 # Main lab page (framework-specific)\n│   ├── variants/\n│   │   ├── VariantA.tsx\n│   │   ├── VariantB.tsx\n│   │   ├── VariantC.tsx\n│   │   ├── VariantD.tsx\n│   │   └── VariantE.tsx\n│   ├── components/\n│   │   └── LabShell.tsx         # Lab layout wrapper\n│   ├── feedback/                # Interactive feedback system\n│   │   ├── types.ts             # TypeScript interfaces\n│   │   ├── selector-utils.ts    # Element identification\n│   │   ├── format-utils.ts      # Feedback formatting\n│   │   ├── FeedbackOverlay.tsx  # Main overlay component\n│   │   └── index.ts             # Module exports\n│   └── data/\n│       └── fixtures.ts          # Shared mock data\n├── design-brief.json\n└── run-log.md\n```\n\n### Feedback System Setup (CRITICAL - NEVER SKIP)\n\n**The FeedbackOverlay is the PRIMARY feature of the Design Lab.** Without it, users cannot provide interactive feedback. NEVER generate a Design Lab without the FeedbackOverlay.\n\n**Reliability Strategy:** To avoid import path issues across different project configurations, create the FeedbackOverlay **directly in the route directory** (e.g., `app/design-lab/FeedbackOverlay.tsx`), NOT in `.claude-design/`. This ensures a simple relative import (`./FeedbackOverlay`) always works.\n\n**Required Files in Route Directory:**\n```\napp/design-lab/           # or app/__design_lab/ if underscores work\n├── page.tsx              # Main lab page with variants\n└── FeedbackOverlay.tsx   # Self-contained overlay component (copy from templates)\n```\n\n**Template Source:** `design-and-refine/templates/feedback/FeedbackOverlay.tsx`\n\n**Why this approach:**\n- `.claude-design/` paths can fail due to bundler configurations\n- Relative imports from the same directory always work\n- The route directory gets deleted during cleanup anyway\n\n### Route Integration\n\n**Next.js App Router:**\nCreate `app/__design_lab/page.tsx` that imports from `.claude-design/lab/`\n\n**Next.js Pages Router:**\nCreate `pages/__design_lab.tsx` that imports from `.claude-design/lab/`\n\n**Vite React:**\n- If React Router exists: add route to `/__design_lab`\n- If no router: create a conditional render in `App.tsx` based on `?design_lab=true` query param\n\n**Other frameworks:**\nCreate the most appropriate temporary route for the detected framework.\n\n### Variant Generation Guidelines\n\n**IMPORTANT:** Read `DESIGN_PRINCIPLES.md` for UX, interaction, and motion best practices. But **DO NOT use predefined visual styles**—infer them from the project.\n\n**Apply universal principles (from DESIGN_PRINCIPLES.md):**\n- **UX**: Nielsen's heuristics, cognitive load reduction, progressive disclosure\n- **Component behavior**: Button states, form anatomy, card structure\n- **Interaction**: Feedback patterns, state handling, optimistic updates\n- **Motion**: Timing (150-300ms), easing (ease-out entrances, ease-in exits)\n- **Accessibility**: Focus states, ARIA patterns, touch targets (44px min)\n\n**Infer visual styles from the project:**\n- Colors → from Tailwind config, CSS variables, or existing components\n- Typography → from existing headings, body text in the codebase\n- Spacing → from the project's spacing scale or existing patterns\n- Border radius → from existing cards, buttons, inputs\n- Shadows → from existing elevated components\n\n---\n\nEach variant MUST explore a different design axis. Do not create minor variations—make them meaningfully distinct. **Use the project's existing visual language for all variants.**\n\n**Variant A: Information Hierarchy Focus**\n- Restructure content hierarchy (what's most important?)\n- Apply Gestalt proximity—group related items closer\n- One primary action per view\n- Use existing typography scale to create clear levels\n\n**Variant B: Layout Model Exploration**\n- Try a different layout approach (card vs list vs table vs split-pane)\n- Apply card anatomy or table behavior patterns from DESIGN_PRINCIPLES\n- Consider responsive behavior at each breakpoint\n- Use the project's existing grid/layout system\n\n**Variant C: Density Variation**\n- If brief says \"comfortable\", try a more compact version\n- If brief says \"compact\", try a more spacious version\n- Use the project's existing spacing tokens—just apply them differently\n- Show the tradeoffs: more visible data vs easier scanning\n\n**Variant D: Interaction Model**\n- Different interaction pattern (modal vs inline vs panel vs drawer)\n- Apply feedback patterns: immediate → progress → completion\n- Implement all required states (loading, error, empty, disabled)\n- Consider optimistic updates for non-destructive actions\n\n**Variant E: Expressive Direction**\n- Push the brand direction the user described in the interview\n- Explore different uses of the project's existing design tokens\n- More or less use of shadows, borders, background colors\n- Apply motion where it adds meaning (hover, focus, transitions)\n\n### Lab Page Requirements\n\nThe Design Lab page must include:\n\n1. **Header** with:\n   - Design Brief summary (target, scope, key requirements)\n   - Instructions for reviewing\n\n2. **Variant Grid** with:\n   - Clear labels (A, B, C, D, E)\n   - Brief rationale for each variant (\"Why this exists\")\n   - The actual rendered variant\n   - Notes highlighting key differences\n   - **IMPORTANT:** Each variant container must have `data-variant=\"X\"` attribute (where X is A, B, C, D, E, or F). This is required for the feedback system to identify which variant comments belong to.\n\n3. **Responsive behavior**:\n   - Desktop: side-by-side grid (2-3 columns)\n   - Mobile: horizontal scroll or tabs\n\n4. **Shared Data**:\n   - All variants use the same fixture data from `data/fixtures.ts`\n   - Ensures fair comparison\n\n5. **Feedback Overlay** (CRITICAL - NEVER OMIT):\n\n   ⚠️ **THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT REQUIREMENT** ⚠️\n\n   The FeedbackOverlay enables users to click on elements and leave comments. Without it, the Design Lab is just a static page with no way to collect structured feedback.\n\n   - Create `FeedbackOverlay.tsx` in the SAME directory as `page.tsx`\n   - Import with relative path: `import { FeedbackOverlay } from './FeedbackOverlay'`\n   - Render at the END of the page, after all variants\n   - Pass `targetName` prop with the component/page name\n\n   **Example integration:**\n\n```tsx\nimport { FeedbackOverlay } from './FeedbackOverlay';  // Relative import - always works\n\nexport default function DesignLabPage() {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"min-h-screen bg-background\">\n      <header>...</header>\n\n      <main>\n        <div className=\"grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 gap-8\">\n          <div data-variant=\"A\">\n            <VariantA />\n          </div>\n          <div data-variant=\"B\">\n            <VariantB />\n          </div>\n          {/* ... more variants */}\n        </div>\n      </main>\n\n      {/* CRITICAL: FeedbackOverlay must be included */}\n      <FeedbackOverlay targetName=\"ComponentName\" />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n   **If you forget the FeedbackOverlay, the user CANNOT provide feedback.** This defeats the entire purpose of the Design Lab.\n\n### Code Quality\n\n**Conventions:**\n- Follow the project's existing code conventions (file naming, imports, etc.)\n- Use the detected styling system (Tailwind, CSS modules, etc.)\n- Use existing components from the project where appropriate\n\n**Accessibility (from DESIGN_PRINCIPLES):**\n- Semantic HTML: `<button>` not `<div onclick>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`\n- Keyboard navigation: all interactive elements focusable and operable\n- Focus states: visible `:focus-visible` with 2px ring and offset\n- Color contrast: 4.5:1 for text, 3:1 for UI elements\n- Touch targets: minimum 44x44px\n- ARIA only when HTML semantics aren't enough\n\n**States (every component needs):**\n- Default, Hover, Focus, Active, Disabled, Loading, Error, Empty\n- See DESIGN_PRINCIPLES \"State Handling\" section\n\n**Motion:**\n- Use appropriate timing: 150-200ms for micro-interactions, 200-300ms for transitions\n- Use ease-out for entrances, ease-in for exits\n- Respect `prefers-reduced-motion`\n\n---\n\n## Phase 4: Present Design Lab to User\n\nAfter generating the lab files, **immediately** present the lab to the user. Do NOT attempt to:\n- Start the dev server yourself (it runs forever and will block)\n- Check if ports are open\n- Open a browser\n- Wait for any server response\n\n### What to Do\n\n1. **Output the lab location and URL:**\n   ```\n   ✅ Design Lab created!\n\n   I've generated 5 design variants in `.claude-design/lab/`\n\n   To view them:\n   1. Make sure your dev server is running (run `pnpm dev` if not)\n   2. Open: http://localhost:3000/__design_lab\n\n   Take your time reviewing the variants side-by-side, then come back and tell me:\n   - Which variant wins (A-E)\n   - What you like about it\n   - What should change\n   ```\n\n2. **Immediately proceed to Phase 5** - ask for feedback. Do NOT wait for the user to say they've opened the browser. Just present the feedback questions right away so they're ready when the user returns.\n\n### Why Not Start the Server\n\nRunning `pnpm dev` or `npm run dev` starts a long-running process that never exits. If you run it, you'll wait forever. The user likely already has their dev server running, or can start it themselves in another terminal.\n\n---\n\n## Phase 5: Collect Feedback\n\nAfter presenting the lab URL, the user can provide feedback in two ways:\n1. **Interactive Feedback** (recommended): Using the built-in overlay in the browser\n2. **Manual Feedback**: Via AskUserQuestion in the terminal\n\n### Interactive Feedback (Primary Method)\n\nThe Design Lab includes a Figma-like feedback overlay. When presenting the lab, include these instructions:\n\n```\n✅ Design Lab created!\n\nI've generated 5 design variants in `.claude-design/lab/`\n\nTo view and provide feedback:\n1. Make sure your dev server is running (run `pnpm dev` if not)\n2. Open: http://localhost:3000/__design_lab\n\n**To add feedback:**\n1. Click the \"Add Feedback\" button (bottom-right corner)\n2. Click any element you want to comment on\n3. Type your feedback and click \"Save\"\n4. Repeat for all elements you want to comment on\n5. Fill in the \"Overall Direction\" field (required)\n6. Click \"Submit All Feedback\"\n7. Paste the copied text here in the terminal\n\nOr just describe your feedback manually below!\n```\n\n**When the user pastes feedback**, it will be in this format:\n\n```markdown\n## Design Lab Feedback\n\n**Target:** ComponentName\n**Comments:** 3\n\n### Variant A\n1. **Button** (`[data-testid='submit']`, button with \"Submit\")\n   \"Make this more prominent\"\n\n### Variant B\n1. **Card** (`.product-card`, div with \"Product Name\")\n   \"Love this layout\"\n\n### Overall Direction\nGo with Variant B's structure. Apply Variant A's button styling.\n```\n\n**How to parse and act on this feedback:**\n\n1. **Read the Overall Direction** first - this guides your synthesis\n2. **For each comment**, locate the element using:\n   - Primary: The CSS selector in backticks (e.g., `[data-testid='submit']`)\n   - Secondary: The element description (e.g., \"button with 'Submit'\")\n3. **Apply the feedback** by editing the corresponding variant file\n\n### Fallback: Manual Feedback via AskUserQuestion\n\nIf the user prefers not to use the interactive overlay (or pastes manual feedback), use the AskUserQuestion flow below:\n\n### Stage 1: Check for a Winner\n\n**Question 1: Ready to pick?**\n- Header: \"Decision\"\n- Question: \"Is there one variant you like as is?\"\n- Options:\n  - \"Yes - I found one I like\" - Ready to select a winner and refine\n  - \"No - I like parts of different ones\" - Need to synthesize a new variant\n\n### Stage 2A: If User Found a Winner\n\nIf user said \"Yes\", ask:\n\n**Question 2a: Which one?**\n- Header: \"Winner\"\n- Question: \"Which variant do you want to go with?\"\n- Options:\n  - \"Variant A\" - [brief description of A]\n  - \"Variant B\" - [brief description of B]\n  - \"Variant C\" - [brief description of C]\n  - \"Variant D\" - [brief description of D]\n  - \"Variant E\" - [brief description of E]\n\n**Question 3a: Any tweaks?**\n- Header: \"Tweaks\"\n- Question: \"Any small changes needed, or is it good as is?\"\n- Options:\n  - \"Good as is\" - No changes needed, proceed to final preview\n  - \"Minor tweaks needed\" - I'll describe what to adjust\n\nIf \"Minor tweaks needed\", ask user to describe changes via text input.\n\nThen proceed to **Phase 7: Final Preview**.\n\n### Stage 2B: If User Wants to Synthesize\n\nIf user said \"No - I like parts of different ones\", ask:\n\n**Question 2b: What do you like about each?**\n- Header: \"Feedback\"\n- Question: \"What do you like about each variant? (mention specific elements from A, B, C, D, E)\"\n- (Let user provide detailed feedback via \"Other\" text input)\n\nExample response format to guide user:\n```\n- A: Love the card layout and spacing\n- B: The color scheme feels right\n- C: The interaction on hover is great\n- D: Nothing stands out\n- E: The typography hierarchy is clearest\n```\n\nThen proceed to **Phase 6: Synthesize New Variant**.\n\n---\n\n## Phase 6: Synthesize New Variant\n\nBased on the user's feedback about what they liked from each variant:\n\n1. **Create a new hybrid variant** (Variant F) that combines:\n   - The specific elements the user called out from each\n   - The best structural decisions across all variants\n   - Any patterns that appeared in multiple variants\n\n2. **Replace the Design Lab** with a comparison view:\n   - Show the new synthesized Variant F prominently\n   - Keep 1-2 of the original variants that were closest for comparison\n   - Remove variants that had nothing the user liked\n\n3. **Update the `/__design_lab` route** to show the new arrangement\n\n4. **Ask for feedback again:**\n\n**Question: How's the new variant?**\n- Header: \"Review\"\n- Question: \"How does the synthesized variant (F) look?\"\n- Options:\n  - \"This is it!\" - Proceed to final preview\n  - \"Getting closer\" - Need another iteration\n  - \"Went the wrong direction\" - Let me clarify what I want\n\nIf \"Getting closer\" or \"Went the wrong direction\", gather more specific feedback and iterate. Support multiple synthesis passes until user is satisfied.\n\nThen proceed to **Phase 7: Final Preview**.\n\n---\n\n## Phase 7: Final Preview\n\nOnce user is satisfied:\n\n1. Create `.claude-design/preview/` directory:\n   ```\n   .claude-design/preview/\n   ├── page.tsx                    # Preview page\n   └── FinalDesign.tsx             # The winning design\n   ```\n\n2. Create route at `/__design_preview`\n\n3. For redesigns, include before/after comparison:\n   - Toggle switch or split view\n   - Show original alongside proposed\n\n4. Ask for final confirmation:\n\n**Question: Confirm final design?**\n- Header: \"Confirm\"\n- Question: \"Ready to finalize this design?\"\n- Options:\n  - \"Yes, finalize it\" - Proceed to cleanup and generate implementation plan\n  - \"No, needs changes\" - Tell me what to adjust\n  - \"Abort - cancel everything\" - Delete all temp files, no plan generated\n\nIf \"No, needs changes\": gather feedback and iterate.\nIf \"Abort\": proceed to **Abort Handling** below.\n\n---\n\n## Abort Handling\n\nIf the user wants to cancel/abort at ANY point during the process (not just final confirmation), they may say things like:\n- \"cancel\"\n- \"abort\"\n- \"stop\"\n- \"nevermind\"\n- \"forget it\"\n- \"I changed my mind\"\n\nWhen abort is detected:\n\n1. **Confirm the abort:**\n   - \"Are you sure you want to cancel? This will delete all the design lab files I created.\"\n\n2. **If confirmed, clean up immediately:**\n   - Delete `.claude-design/` directory entirely\n   - Delete temporary route files (`app/__design_lab/`, etc.)\n   - Do NOT generate any implementation plan\n   - Do NOT update Design Memory\n\n3. **Acknowledge:**\n   - \"Design exploration cancelled. All temporary files have been cleaned up.

Generates creative, polished code and UI design that avoids generic AI aesthetics.",
    "content": "This skill guides creation of distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces that avoid generic \"AI slop\" aesthetics. Implement real working code with exceptional attention to aesthetic details and creative choices.\n\nThe user provides frontend requirements: a component, page, application, or interface to build. They may include context about the purpose, audience, or technical constraints.\n\n## Design Thinking\n\nBefore coding, understand the context and commit to a BOLD aesthetic direction:\n- **Purpose**: What problem does this interface solve? Who uses it?\n- **Tone**: Pick an extreme: brutally minimal, maximalist chaos, retro-futuristic, organic/natural, luxury/refined, playful/toy-like, editorial/magazine, brutalist/raw, art deco/geometric, soft/pastel, industrial/utilitarian, etc. There are so many flavors to choose from. Use these for inspiration but design one that is true to the aesthetic direction.\n- **Constraints**: Technical requirements (framework, performance, accessibility).\n- **Differentiation**: What makes this UNFORGETTABLE? What's the one thing someone will remember?\n\n**CRITICAL**: Choose a clear conceptual direction and execute it with precision. Bold maximalism and refined minimalism both work - the key is intentionality, not intensity.\n\nThen implement working code (HTML/CSS/JS, React, Vue, etc.) that is:\n- Production-grade and functional\n- Visually striking and memorable\n- Cohesive with a clear aesthetic point-of-view\n- Meticulously refined in every detail\n\n## Frontend Aesthetics Guidelines\n\nFocus on:\n- **Typography**: Choose fonts that are beautiful, unique, and interesting. Avoid generic fonts like Arial and Inter; opt instead for distinctive choices that elevate the frontend's aesthetics; unexpected, characterful font choices. Pair a distinctive display font with a refined body font.\n- **Color & Theme**: Commit to a cohesive aesthetic. Use CSS variables for consistency. Dominant colors with sharp accents outperform timid, evenly-distributed palettes.\n- **Motion**: Use animations for effects and micro-interactions. Prioritize CSS-only solutions for HTML. Use Motion library for React when available. Focus on high-impact moments: one well-orchestrated page load with staggered reveals (animation-delay) creates more delight than scattered micro-interactions. Use scroll-triggering and hover states that surprise.\n- **Spatial Composition**: Unexpected layouts. Asymmetry. Overlap. Diagonal flow. Grid-breaking elements. Generous negative space OR controlled density.\n- **Backgrounds & Visual Details**: Create atmosphere and depth rather than defaulting to solid colors. Add contextual effects and textures that match the overall aesthetic. Apply creative forms like gradient meshes, noise textures, geometric patterns, layered transparencies, dramatic shadows, decorative borders, custom cursors, and grain overlays.\n\nNEVER use generic AI-generated aesthetics like overused font families (Inter, Roboto, Arial, system fonts), cliched color schemes (particularly purple gradients on white backgrounds), predictable layouts and component patterns, and cookie-cutter design that lacks context-specific character.\n\nInterpret creatively and make unexpected choices that feel genuinely designed for the context. No design should be the same. Vary between light and dark themes, different fonts, different aesthetics. NEVER converge on common choices (Space Grotesk, for example) across generations.\n\n**IMPORTANT**: Match implementation complexity to the aesthetic vision. Maximalist designs need elaborate code with extensive animations and effects. Minimalist or refined designs need restraint, precision, and careful attention to spacing, typography, and subtle details. Elegance comes from executing the vision well.\n\nRemember: Claude is capable of extraordinary creative work. Don't hold back, show what can truly be created when thinking outside the box and committing fully to a distinctive vision."

    "content": "# Interaction Design\n\nCreate engaging, intuitive interactions through motion, feedback, and thoughtful state transitions that enhance usability and delight users.\n\n## When to Use This Skill\n\n- Adding microinteractions to enhance user feedback\n- Implementing smooth page and component transitions\n- Designing loading states and skeleton screens\n- Creating gesture-based interactions\n- Building notification and toast systems\n- Implementing drag-and-drop interfaces\n- Adding scroll-triggered animations\n- Designing hover and focus states\n\n## Core Principles\n\n### 1. Purposeful Motion\n\nMotion should communicate, not decorate:\n\n- **Feedback**: Confirm user actions occurred\n- **Orientation**: Show where elements come from/go to\n- **Focus**: Direct attention to important changes\n- **Continuity**: Maintain context during transitions\n\n### 2. Timing Guidelines\n\n| Duration  | Use Case                                  |\n| --------- | ----------------------------------------- |\n| 100-150ms | Micro-feedback (hovers, clicks)           |\n| 200-300ms | Small transitions (toggles, dropdowns)    |\n| 300-500ms | Medium transitions (modals, page changes) |\n| 500ms+    | Complex choreographed animations          |\n\n### 3. Easing Functions\n\n```css\n/* Common easings */\n--ease-out: cubic-bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1); /* Decelerate - entering */\n--ease-in: cubic-bezier(0.55, 0, 1, 0.45); /* Accelerate - exiting */\n--ease-in-out: cubic-bezier(0.65, 0, 0.35, 1); /* Both - moving between */\n--spring: cubic-bezier(0.34, 1.56, 0.64, 1); /* Overshoot - playful */\n```\n\n## Quick Start: Button Microinteraction\n\n```tsx\nimport { motion } from \"framer-motion\";\n\nexport function InteractiveButton({ children, onClick }) {\n  return (\n    <motion.button\n      onClick={onClick}\n      whileHover={{ scale: 1.02 }}\n      whileTap={{ scale: 0.98 }}\n      transition={{ type: \"spring\", stiffness: 400, damping: 17 }}\n      className=\"px-4 py-2 bg-blue-600 text-white rounded-lg\"\n    >\n      {children}\n    </motion.button>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n## Interaction Patterns\n\n### 1. Loading States\n\n**Skeleton Screens**: Preserve layout while loading\n\n```tsx\nfunction CardSkeleton() {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"animate-pulse\">\n      <div className=\"h-48 bg-gray-200 rounded-lg\" />\n      <div className=\"mt-4 h-4 bg-gray-200 rounded w-3/4\" />\n      <div className=\"mt-2 h-4 bg-gray-200 rounded w-1/2\" />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n**Progress Indicators**: Show determinate progress\n\n```tsx\nfunction ProgressBar({ progress }: { progress: number }) {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"h-2 bg-gray-200 rounded-full overflow-hidden\">\n      <motion.div\n        className=\"h-full bg-blue-600\"\n        initial={{ width: 0 }}\n        animate={{ width: `${progress}%` }}\n        transition={{ ease: \"easeOut\" }}\n      />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### 2. State Transitions\n\n**Toggle with smooth transition**:\n\n```tsx\nfunction Toggle({ checked, onChange }) {\n  return (\n    <button\n      role=\"switch\"\n      aria-checked={checked}\n      onClick={() => onChange(!checked)}\n      className={`\n        relative w-12 h-6 rounded-full transition-colors duration-200\n        ${checked ? \"bg-blue-600\" : \"bg-gray-300\"}\n      `}\n    >\n      <motion.span\n        className=\"absolute top-1 left-1 w-4 h-4 bg-white rounded-full shadow\"\n        animate={{ x: checked ? 24 : 0 }}\n        transition={{ type: \"spring\", stiffness: 500, damping: 30 }}\n      />\n    </button>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### 3. Page Transitions\n\n**Framer Motion layout animations**:\n\n```tsx\nimport { AnimatePresence, motion } from \"framer-motion\";\n\nfunction PageTransition({ children, key }) {\n  return (\n    <AnimatePresence mode=\"wait\">\n      <motion.div\n        key={key}\n        initial={{ opacity: 0, y: 20 }}\n        animate={{ opacity: 1, y: 0 }}\n        exit={{ opacity: 0, y: -20 }}\n        transition={{ duration: 0.3 }}\n      >\n        {children}\n      </motion.div>\n    </AnimatePresence>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### 4. Feedback Patterns\n\n**Ripple effect on click**:\n\n```tsx\nfunction RippleButton({ children, onClick }) {\n  const [ripples, setRipples] = useState([]);\n\n  const handleClick = (e) => {\n    const rect = e.currentTarget.getBoundingClientRect();\n    const ripple = {\n      x: e.clientX - rect.left,\n      y: e.clientY - rect.top,\n      id: Date.now(),\n    };\n    setRipples((prev) => [...prev, ripple]);\n    setTimeout(() => {\n      setRipples((prev) => prev.filter((r) => r.id !== ripple.id));\n    }, 600);\n    onClick?.(e);\n  };\n\n  return (\n    <button onClick={handleClick} className=\"relative overflow-hidden\">\n      {children}\n      {ripples.map((ripple) => (\n        <span\n          key={ripple.id}\n          className=\"absolute bg-white/30 rounded-full animate-ripple\"\n          style={{ left: ripple.x, top: ripple.y }}\n        />\n      ))}\n    </button>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### 5. Gesture Interactions\n\n**Swipe to dismiss**:\n\n```tsx\nfunction SwipeCard({ children, onDismiss }) {\n  return (\n    <motion.div\n      drag=\"x\"\n      dragConstraints={{ left: 0, right: 0 }}\n      onDragEnd={(_, info) => {\n        if (Math.abs(info.offset.x) > 100) {\n          onDismiss();\n        }\n      }}\n      className=\"cursor-grab active:cursor-grabbing\"\n    >\n      {children}\n    </motion.div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n## CSS Animation Patterns\n\n### Keyframe Animations\n\n```css\n@keyframes fadeIn {\n  from {\n    opacity: 0;\n    transform: translateY(10px);\n  }\n  to {\n    opacity: 1;\n    transform: translateY(0);\n  }\n}\n\n@keyframes pulse {\n  0%,\n  100% {\n    opacity: 1;\n  }\n  50% {\n    opacity: 0.5;\n  }\n}\n\n@keyframes spin {\n  to {\n    transform: rotate(360deg);\n  }\n}\n\n.animate-fadeIn {\n  animation: fadeIn 0.3s ease-out;\n}\n.animate-pulse {\n  animation: pulse 2s ease-in-out infinite;\n}\n.animate-spin {\n  animation: spin 1s linear infinite;\n}\n```\n\n### CSS Transitions\n\n```css\n.card {\n  transition:\n    transform 0.2s ease-out,\n    box-shadow 0.2s ease-out;\n}\n\n.card:hover {\n  transform: translateY(-4px);\n  box-shadow: 0 12px 24px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);\n}\n```\n\n## Accessibility Considerations\n\n```css\n/* Respect user motion preferences */\n@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {\n  *,\n  *::before,\n  *::after {\n    animation-duration: 0.01ms !important;\n    animation-iteration-count: 1 !important;\n    transition-duration: 0.01ms !important;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n```tsx\nfunction AnimatedComponent() {\n  const prefersReducedMotion = window.matchMedia(\n    \"(prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)\",\n  ).matches;\n\n  return (\n    <motion.div\n      animate={{ opacity: 1 }}\n      transition={{ duration: prefersReducedMotion ? 0 : 0.3 }}\n    />\n  );\n}\n```\n\n## Best Practices\n\n1. **Performance First**: Use `transform` and `opacity` for smooth 60fps\n2. **Reduce Motion Support**: Always respect `prefers-reduced-motion`\n3. **Consistent Timing**: Use a timing scale across the app\n4. **Natural Physics**: Prefer spring animations over linear\n5. **Interruptible**: Allow users to cancel long animations\n6. **Progressive Enhancement**: Work without JS animations\n7. **Test on Devices**: Performance varies significantly\n\n## Common Issues\n\n- **Janky Animations**: Avoid animating `width`, `height`, `top`, `left`\n- **Over-animation**: Too much motion causes fatigue\n- **Blocking Interactions**: Never prevent user input during animations\n- **Memory Leaks**: Clean up animation listeners on unmount\n- **Flash of Content**: Use `will-change` sparingly for optimization\n\n## Resources\n\n- [Framer Motion Documentation](https://www.framer.com/motion/)\n- [CSS Animation Guide](https://web.dev/animations-guide/)\n- [Material Design Motion](https://m3.material.io/styles/motion/overview)\n- [GSAP Animation Library](https://greensock.com/gsap/)"

    "description": "This skill is for interface design — dashboards, admin panels, apps, tools, and interactive products. NOT for marketing design (landing pages, marketing sites, campaigns).",
    "content": "# Interface Design\n\nBuild interface design with craft and consistency.\n\n## Scope\n\n**Use for:** Dashboards, admin panels, SaaS apps, tools, settings pages, data interfaces.\n\n**Not for:** Landing pages, marketing sites, campaigns. Redirect those to `/frontend-design`.\n\n---\n\n# The Problem\n\nYou will generate generic output. Your training has seen thousands of dashboards. The patterns are strong.\n\nYou can follow the entire process below — explore the domain, name a signature, state your intent — and still produce a template. Warm colors on cold structures. Friendly fonts on generic layouts. \"Kitchen feel\" that looks like every other app.\n\nThis happens because intent lives in prose, but code generation pulls from patterns. The gap between them is where defaults win.\n\nThe process below helps. But process alone doesn't guarantee craft. You have to catch yourself.\n\n---\n\n# Where Defaults Hide\n\nDefaults don't announce themselves. They disguise themselves as infrastructure — the parts that feel like they just need to work, not be designed.\n\n**Typography feels like a container.** Pick something readable, move on. But typography isn't holding your design — it IS your design. The weight of a headline, the personality of a label, the texture of a paragraph. These shape how the product feels before anyone reads a word. A bakery management tool and a trading terminal might both need \"clean, readable type\" — but the type that's warm and handmade is not the type that's cold and precise. If you're reaching for your usual font, you're not designing.\n\n**Navigation feels like scaffolding.** Build the sidebar, add the links, get to the real work. But navigation isn't around your product — it IS your product. Where you are, where you can go, what matters most. A page floating in space is a component demo, not software. The navigation teaches people how to think about the space they're in.\n\n**Data feels like presentation.** You have numbers, show numbers. But a number on screen is not design. The question is: what does this number mean to the person looking at it? What will they do with it? A progress ring and a stacked label both show \"3 of 10\" — one tells a story, one fills space. If you're reaching for number-on-label, you're not designing.\n\n**Token names feel like implementation detail.** But your CSS variables are design decisions. `--ink` and `--parchment` evoke a world. `--gray-700` and `--surface-2` evoke a template. Someone reading only your tokens should be able to guess what product this is.\n\nThe trap is thinking some decisions are creative and others are structural. There are no structural decisions. Everything is design. The moment you stop asking \"why this?\" is the moment defaults take over.\n\n---\n\n# Intent First\n\nBefore touching code, answer these. Not in your head — out loud, to yourself or the user.\n\n**Who is this human?**\nNot \"users.\" The actual person. Where are they when they open this? What's on their mind? What did they do 5 minutes ago, what will they do 5 minutes after? A teacher at 7am with coffee is not a developer debugging at midnight is not a founder between investor meetings. Their world shapes the interface.\n\n**What must they accomplish?**\nNot \"use the dashboard.\" The verb. Grade these submissions. Find the broken deployment. Approve the payment. The answer determines what leads, what follows, what hides.\n\n**What should this feel like?**\nSay it in words that mean something. \"Clean and modern\" means nothing — every AI says that. Warm like a notebook? Cold like a terminal? Dense like a trading floor? Calm like a reading app? The answer shapes color, type, spacing, density — everything.\n\nIf you cannot answer these with specifics, stop. Ask the user. Do not guess. Do not default.\n\n## Every Choice Must Be A Choice\n\nFor every decision, you must be able to explain WHY.\n\n- Why this layout and not another?\n- Why this color temperature?\n- Why this typeface?\n- Why this spacing scale?\n- Why this information hierarchy?\n\nIf your answer is \"it's common\" or \"it's clean\" or \"it works\" — you haven't chosen. You've defaulted. Defaults are invisible. Invisible choices compound into generic output.\n\n**The test:** If you swapped your choices for the most common alternatives and the design didn't feel meaningfully different, you never made real choices.\n\n## Sameness Is Failure\n\nIf another AI, given a similar prompt, would produce substantially the same output — you have failed.\n\nThis is not about being different for its own sake. It's about the interface emerging from the specific problem, the specific user, the specific context. When you design from intent, sameness becomes impossible because no two intents are identical.\n\nWhen you design from defaults, everything looks the same because defaults are shared.\n\n## Intent Must Be Systemic\n\nSaying \"warm\" and using cold colors is not following through. Intent is not a label — it's a constraint that shapes every decision.\n\nIf the intent is warm: surfaces, text, borders, accents, semantic colors, typography — all warm. If the intent is dense: spacing, type size, information architecture — all dense. If the intent is calm: motion, contrast, color saturation — all calm.\n\nCheck your output against your stated intent. Does every token reinforce it? Or did you state an intent and then default anyway?\n\n---\n\n# Product Domain Exploration\n\nThis is where defaults get caught — or don't.\n\nGeneric output: Task type → Visual template → Theme\nCrafted output: Task type → Product domain → Signature → Structure + Expression\n\nThe difference: time in the product's world before any visual or structural thinking.\n\n## Required Outputs\n\n**Do not propose any direction until you produce all four:**\n\n**Domain:** Concepts, metaphors, vocabulary from this product's world. Not features — territory. Minimum 5.\n\n**Color world:** What colors exist naturally in this product's domain? Not \"warm\" or \"cool\" — go to the actual world. If this product were a physical space, what would you see? What colors belong there that don't belong elsewhere? List 5+.\n\n**Signature:** One element — visual, structural, or interaction — that could only exist for THIS product. If you can't name one, keep exploring.\n\n**Defaults:** 3 obvious choices for this interface type — visual AND structural. You can't avoid patterns you haven't named.\n\n## Proposal Requirements\n\nYour direction must explicitly reference:\n- Domain concepts you explored\n- Colors from your color world exploration\n- Your signature element\n- What replaces each default\n\n**The test:** Read your proposal. Remove the product name. Could someone identify what this is for? If not, it's generic. Explore deeper.\n\n---\n\n# The Mandate\n\n**Before showing the user, look at what you made.**\n\nAsk yourself: \"If they said this lacks craft, what would they mean?\"\n\nThat thing you just thought of — fix it first.\n\nYour first output is probably generic. That's normal. The work is catching it before the user has to.\n\n## The Checks\n\nRun these against your output before presenting:\n\n- **The swap test:** If you swapped the typeface for your usual one, would anyone notice? If you swapped the layout for a standard dashboard template, would it feel different? The places where swapping wouldn't matter are the places you defaulted.\n\n- **The squint test:** Blur your eyes. Can you still perceive hierarchy? Is anything jumping out harshly? Craft whispers.\n\n- **The signature test:** Can you point to five specific elements where your signature appears? Not \"the overall feel\" — actual components. A signature you can't locate doesn't exist.\n\n- **The token test:** Read your CSS variables out loud. Do they sound like they belong to this product's world, or could they belong to any project?\n\nIf any check fails, iterate before showing.\n\n---\n\n# Craft Foundations\n\n## Subtle Layering\n\nThis is the backbone of craft. Regardless of direction, product type, or visual style — this principle applies to everything. You should barely notice the system working. When you look at Vercel's dashboard, you don't think \"nice borders.\" You just understand the structure. The craft is invisible — that's how you know it's working.\n\n### Surface Elevation\n\nSurfaces stack. A dropdown sits above a card which sits above the page. Build a numbered system — base, then increasing elevation levels. In dark mode, higher elevation = slightly lighter. In light mode, higher elevation = slightly lighter or uses shadow.\n\nEach jump should be only a few percentage points of lightness. You can barely see the difference in isolation. But when surfaces stack, the hierarchy emerges. Whisper-quiet shifts that you feel rather than see.\n\n**Key decisions:**\n- **Sidebars:** Same background as canvas, not different. Different colors fragment the visual space into \"sidebar world\" and \"content world.\" A subtle border is enough separation.\n- **Dropdowns:** One level above their parent surface. If both share the same level, the dropdown blends into the card and layering is lost.\n- **Inputs:** Slightly darker than their surroundings, not lighter. Inputs are \"inset\" — they receive content. A darker background signals \"type here\" without heavy borders.\n\n### Borders\n\nBorders should disappear when you're not looking for them, but be findable when you need structure. Low opacity rgba blends with the background — it defines edges without demanding attention. Solid hex borders look harsh in comparison.\n\nBuild a progression — not all borders are equal. Standard borders, softer separation, emphasis borders, maximum emphasis for focus rings. Match intensity to the importance of the boundary.\n\n**The squint test:** Blur your eyes at the interface. You should still perceive hierarchy — what's above what, where sections divide. But nothing should jump out. No harsh lines. No jarring color shifts. Just quiet structure.\n\nThis separates professional interfaces from amateur ones. Get this wrong and nothing else matters.\n\n## Infinite Expression\n\nEvery pattern has infinite expressions. **No interface should look the same.**\n\nA metric display could be a hero number, inline stat, sparkline, gauge, progress bar, comparison delta, trend badge, or something new. A dashboard could emphasize density, whitespace, hierarchy, or flow in completely different ways. Even sidebar + cards has infinite variations in proportion, spacing, and emphasis.\n\n**Before building, ask:**\n- What's the ONE thing users do most here?\n- What products solve similar problems brilliantly? Study them.\n- Why would this interface feel designed for its purpose, not templated?\n\n**NEVER produce identical output.** Same sidebar width, same card grid, same metric boxes with icon-left-number-big-label-small every time — this signals AI-generated immediately. It's forgettable.\n\nThe architecture and components should emerge from the task and data, executed in a way that feels fresh. Linear's cards don't look like Notion's. Vercel's metrics don't look like Stripe's. Same concepts, infinite expressions.\n\n## Color Lives Somewhere\n\nEvery product exists in a world. That world has colors.\n\nBefore you reach for a palette, spend time in the product's world. What would you see if you walked into the physical version of this space? What materials? What light? What objects?\n\nYour palette should feel like it came FROM somewhere — not like it was applied TO something.\n\n**Beyond Warm and Cold:** Temperature is one axis. Is this quiet or loud? Dense or spacious? Serious or playful? Geometric or organic? A trading terminal and a meditation app are both \"focused\" — completely different kinds of focus. Find the specific quality, not the generic label.\n\n**Color Carries Meaning:** Gray builds structure. Color communicates — status, action, emphasis, identity. Unmotivated color is noise. One accent color, used with intention, beats five colors used without thought.\n\n---\n\n# Before Writing Each Component\n\n**Every time** you write UI code — even small additions — state:\n\n```\nIntent: [who is this human, what must they do, how should it feel]\nPalette: [colors from your exploration — and WHY they fit this product's world]\nDepth: [borders / shadows / layered — and WHY this fits the intent]\nSurfaces: [your elevation scale — and WHY this color temperature]\nTypography: [your typeface — and WHY it fits the intent]\nSpacing: [your base unit]\n```\n\nThis checkpoint is mandatory. It forces you to connect every technical choice back to intent.\n\nIf you can't explain WHY for each choice, you're defaulting. Stop and think.\n\n---\n\n# Design Principles\n\n## Token Architecture\n\nEvery color in your interface should trace back to a small set of primitives: foreground (text hierarchy), background (surface elevation), border (separation hierarchy), brand, and semantic (destructive, warning, success). No random hex values — everything maps to primitives.\n\n### Text Hierarchy\n\nDon't just have \"text\" and \"gray text.\" Build four levels — primary, secondary, tertiary, muted. Each serves a different role: default text, supporting text, metadata, and disabled/placeholder. Use all four consistently. If you're only using two, your hierarchy is too flat.\n\n### Border Progression\n\nBorders aren't binary. Build a scale that matches intensity to importance — standard separation, softer separation, emphasis, maximum emphasis. Not every boundary deserves the same weight.\n\n### Control Tokens\n\nForm controls have specific needs. Don't reuse surface tokens — create dedicated ones for control backgrounds, control borders, and focus states. This lets you tune interactive elements independently from layout surfaces.\n\n## Spacing\n\nPick a base unit and stick to multiples. Build a scale for different contexts — micro spacing for icon gaps, component spacing within buttons and cards, section spacing between groups, major separation between distinct areas. Random values signal no system.\n\n## Padding\n\nKeep it symmetrical. If one side has a value, others should match unless content naturally requires asymmetry.\n\n## Depth\n\nChoose ONE approach and commit:\n- **Borders-only** — Clean, technical. For dense tools.\n- **Subtle shadows** — Soft lift. For approachable products.\n- **Layered shadows** — Premium, dimensional. For cards that need presence.\n- **Surface color shifts** — Background tints establish hierarchy without shadows.\n\nDon't mix approaches.\n\n## Border Radius\n\nSharper feels technical. Rounder feels friendly. Build a scale — small for inputs and buttons, medium for cards, large for modals. Don't mix sharp and soft randomly.\n\n## Typography\n\nBuild distinct levels distinguishable at a glance. Headlines need weight and tight tracking for presence. Body needs comfortable weight for readability. Labels need medium weight that works at smaller sizes. Data needs monospace with tabular number spacing for alignment. Don't rely on size alone — combine size, weight, and letter-spacing.\n\n## Card Layouts\n\nA metric card doesn't have to look like a plan card doesn't have to look like a settings card. Design each card's internal structure for its specific content — but keep the surface treatment consistent: same border weight, shadow depth, corner radius, padding scale.\n\n## Controls\n\nNative `<select>` and `<input type=\"date\">` render OS-native elements that cannot be styled. Build custom components — trigger buttons with positioned dropdowns, calendar popovers, styled state management.\n\n## Iconography\n\nIcons clarify, not decorate — if removing an icon loses no meaning, remove it. Choose one icon set and stick with it. Give standalone icons presence with subtle background containers.\n\n## Animation\n\nFast micro-interactions, smooth easing. Larger transitions can be slightly longer. Use deceleration easing. Avoid spring/bounce in professional interfaces.\n\n## States\n\nEvery interactive element needs states: default, hover, active, focus, disabled. Data needs states too: loading, empty, error. Missing states feel broken.\n\n## Navigation Context\n\nScreens need grounding. A data table floating in space feels like a component demo, not a product. Include navigation showing where you are in the app, location indicators, and user context. When building sidebars, consider same background as main content with border separation rather than different colors.\n\n## Dark Mode\n\nDark interfaces have different needs. Shadows are less visible on dark backgrounds — lean on borders for definition. Semantic colors (success, warning, error) often need slight desaturation. The hierarchy system still applies, just with inverted values.\n\n---\n\n# Avoid\n\n- **Harsh borders** — if borders are the first thing you see, they're too strong\n- **Dramatic surface jumps** — elevation changes should be whisper-quiet\n- **Inconsistent spacing** — the clearest sign of no system\n- **Mixed depth strategies** — pick one approach and commit\n- **Missing interaction states** — hover, focus, disabled, loading, error\n- **Dramatic drop shadows** — shadows should be subtle, not attention-grabbing\n- **Large radius on small elements**\n- **Pure white cards on colored backgrounds**\n- **Thick decorative borders**\n- **Gradients and color for decoration** — color should mean something\n- **Multiple accent colors** — dilutes focus\n- **Different hues for different surfaces** — keep the same hue, shift only lightness\n\n---\n\n# Workflow\n\n## Communication\nBe invisible. Don't announce modes or narrate process.\n\n**Never say:** \"I'm in ESTABLISH MODE\", \"Let me check system.md...\"\n\n**Instead:** Jump into work. State suggestions with reasoning.\n\n## Suggest + Ask\nLead with your exploration and recommendation, then confirm:\n```\n\"Domain: [5+ concepts from the product's world]\nColor world: [5+ colors that exist in this domain]\nSignature: [one element unique to this product]\nRejecting: [default 1] → [alternative], [default 2] → [alternative], [default 3] → [alternative]\n\nDirection: [approach that connects to the above]\"\n\n[Ask: \"Does that direction feel right?\"]\n```\n\n## If Project Has system.md\nRead `.interface-design/system.md` and apply. Decisions are made.\n\n## If No system.md\n1. Explore domain — Produce all four required outputs\n2. Propose — Direction must reference all four\n3. Confirm — Get user buy-in\n4. Build — Apply principles\n5. **Evaluate** — Run the mandate checks before showing\n6. Offer to save\n\n---\n\n# After Completing a Task\n\nWhen you finish building something, **always offer to save**:\n\n```\n\"Want me to save these patterns for future sessions?\"\n```\n\nIf yes, write to `.interface-design/system.md`:\n- Direction and feel\n- Depth strategy (borders/shadows/layered)\n- Spacing base unit\n- Key component patterns\n\n### What to Save\n\nAdd patterns when a component is used 2+ times, is reusable across the project, or has specific measurements worth remembering. Don't save one-off components, temporary experiments, or variations better handled with props.\n\n### Consistency Checks\n\nIf system.md defines values, check against them: spacing on the defined grid, depth using the declared strategy throughout, colors from the defined palette, documented patterns reused instead of reinvented.\n\nThis compounds — each save makes future work faster and more consistent.\n\n---\n\n# Deep Dives\n\nFor more detail on specific topics:\n- `references/principles.md` — Code examples, specific values, dark mode\n- `references/validation.md` — Memory management, when to update system.md\n- `references/critique.md` — Post-build craft critique protocol\n\n# Commands\n\n- `/interface-design:status` — Current system state\n- `/interface-design:audit` — Check code against system\n- `/interface-design:extract` — Extract patterns from code\n- `/interface-design:critique` — Critique your build for craft, then rebuild what defaulted"

    "description": "Best practices and example-driven guidance for building SwiftUI views and components. Use when creating or refactoring SwiftUI UI, designing tab architecture with TabView, composing screens, or needing component-specific patterns and examples.",
    "content": "# SwiftUI UI Patterns\n\n## Quick start\n\nChoose a track based on your goal:\n\n### Existing project\n\n- Identify the feature or screen and the primary interaction model (list, detail, editor, settings, tabbed).\n- Find a nearby example in the repo with `rg \"TabView\\(\"` or similar, then read the closest SwiftUI view.\n- Apply local conventions: prefer SwiftUI-native state, keep state local when possible, and use environment injection for shared dependencies.\n- Choose the relevant component reference from `references/components-index.md` and follow its guidance.\n- Build the view with small, focused subviews and SwiftUI-native data flow.\n\n### New project scaffolding\n\n- Start with `references/app-scaffolding-wiring.md` to wire TabView + NavigationStack + sheets.\n- Add a minimal `AppTab` and `RouterPath` based on the provided skeletons.\n- Choose the next component reference based on the UI you need first (TabView, NavigationStack, Sheets).\n- Expand the route and sheet enums as new screens are added.\n\n## General rules to follow\n\n- Use modern SwiftUI state (`@State`, `@Binding`, `@Observable`, `@Environment`) and avoid unnecessary view models.\n- Prefer composition; keep views small and focused.\n- Use async/await with `.task` and explicit loading/error states.\n- Maintain existing legacy patterns only when editing legacy files.\n- Follow the project's formatter and style guide.\n- **Sheets**: Prefer `.sheet(item:)` over `.sheet(isPresented:)` when state represents a selected model. Avoid `if let` inside a sheet body. Sheets should own their actions and call `dismiss()` internally instead of forwarding `onCancel`/`onConfirm` closures.\n\n## Workflow for a new SwiftUI view\n\n1. Define the view's state and its ownership location.\n2. Identify dependencies to inject via `@Environment`.\n3. Sketch the view hierarchy and extract repeated parts into subviews.\n4. Implement async loading with `.task` and explicit state enum if needed.\n5. Add accessibility labels or identifiers when the UI is interactive.\n6. Validate with a build and update usage callsites if needed.\n\n## Component references\n\nUse `references/components-index.md` as the entry point. Each component reference should include:\n- Intent and best-fit scenarios.\n- Minimal usage pattern with local conventions.\n- Pitfalls and performance notes.\n- Paths to existing examples in the current repo.\n\n## Sheet patterns\n\n### Item-driven sheet (preferred)\n\n```swift\n@State private var selectedItem: Item?\n\n.sheet(item: $selectedItem) { item in\n    EditItemSheet(item: item)\n}\n```\n\n### Sheet owns its actions\n\n```swift\nstruct EditItemSheet: View {\n    @Environment(\\.dismiss) private var dismiss\n    @Environment(Store.self) private var store\n\n    let item: Item\n    @State private var isSaving = false\n\n    var body: some View {\n        VStack {\n            Button(isSaving ? \"Saving…\" : \"Save\") {\n                Task { await save() }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    private func save() async {\n        isSaving = true\n        await store.save(item)\n        dismiss()\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## Adding a new component reference\n\n- Create `references/<component>.md`.\n- Keep it short and actionable; link to concrete files in the current repo.\n- Update `references/components-index.md` with the new entry."

    "content": "# UI/UX Pro Max - Design Intelligence\n\nComprehensive design guide for web and mobile applications. Contains 50+ styles, 97 color palettes, 57 font pairings, 99 UX guidelines, and 25 chart types across 9 technology stacks. Searchable database with priority-based recommendations.\n\n## When to Apply\n\nReference these guidelines when:\n- Designing new UI components or pages\n- Choosing color palettes and typography\n- Reviewing code for UX issues\n- Building landing pages or dashboards\n- Implementing accessibility requirements\n\n## Rule Categories by Priority\n\n| Priority | Category | Impact | Domain |\n|----------|----------|--------|--------|\n| 1 | Accessibility | CRITICAL | `ux` |\n| 2 | Touch & Interaction | CRITICAL | `ux` |\n| 3 | Performance | HIGH | `ux` |\n| 4 | Layout & Responsive | HIGH | `ux` |\n| 5 | Typography & Color | MEDIUM | `typography`, `color` |\n| 6 | Animation | MEDIUM | `ux` |\n| 7 | Style Selection | MEDIUM | `style`, `product` |\n| 8 | Charts & Data | LOW | `chart` |\n\n## Quick Reference\n\n### 1. Accessibility (CRITICAL)\n\n- `color-contrast` - Minimum 4.5:1 ratio for normal text\n- `focus-states` - Visible focus rings on interactive elements\n- `alt-text` - Descriptive alt text for meaningful images\n- `aria-labels` - aria-label for icon-only buttons\n- `keyboard-nav` - Tab order matches visual order\n- `form-labels` - Use label with for attribute\n\n### 2. Touch & Interaction (CRITICAL)\n\n- `touch-target-size` - Minimum 44x44px touch targets\n- `hover-vs-tap` - Use click/tap for primary interactions\n- `loading-buttons` - Disable button during async operations\n- `error-feedback` - Clear error messages near problem\n- `cursor-pointer` - Add cursor-pointer to clickable elements\n\n### 3. Performance (HIGH)\n\n- `image-optimization` - Use WebP, srcset, lazy loading\n- `reduced-motion` - Check prefers-reduced-motion\n- `content-jumping` - Reserve space for async content\n\n### 4. Layout & Responsive (HIGH)\n\n- `viewport-meta` - width=device-width initial-scale=1\n- `readable-font-size` - Minimum 16px body text on mobile\n- `horizontal-scroll` - Ensure content fits viewport width\n- `z-index-management` - Define z-index scale (10, 20, 30, 50)\n\n### 5. Typography & Color (MEDIUM)\n\n- `line-height` - Use 1.5-1.75 for body text\n- `line-length` - Limit to 65-75 characters per line\n- `font-pairing` - Match heading/body font personalities\n\n### 6. Animation (MEDIUM)\n\n- `duration-timing` - Use 150-300ms for micro-interactions\n- `transform-performance` - Use transform/opacity, not width/height\n- `loading-states` - Skeleton screens or spinners\n\n### 7. Style Selection (MEDIUM)\n\n- `style-match` - Match style to product type\n- `consistency` - Use same style across all pages\n- `no-emoji-icons` - Use SVG icons, not emojis\n\n### 8. Charts & Data (LOW)\n\n- `chart-type` - Match chart type to data type\n- `color-guidance` - Use accessible color palettes\n- `data-table` - Provide table alternative for accessibility\n\n## How to Use\n\nSearch specific domains using the CLI tool below.\n\n---\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nCheck if Python is installed:\n\n```bash\npython3 --version || python --version\n```\n\nIf Python is not installed, install it based on user's OS:\n\n**macOS:**\n```bash\nbrew install python3\n```\n\n**Ubuntu/Debian:**\n```bash\nsudo apt update && sudo apt install python3\n```\n\n**Windows:**\n```powershell\nwinget install Python.Python.3.12\n```\n\n---\n\n## How to Use This Skill\n\nWhen user requests UI/UX work (design, build, create, implement, review, fix, improve), follow this workflow:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze User Requirements\n\nExtract key information from user request:\n- **Product type**: SaaS, e-commerce, portfolio, dashboard, landing page, etc.\n- **Style keywords**: minimal, playful, professional, elegant, dark mode, etc.\n- **Industry**: healthcare, fintech, gaming, education, etc.\n- **Stack**: React, Vue, Next.js, or default to `html-tailwind`\n\n### Step 2: Generate Design System (REQUIRED)\n\n**Always start with `--design-system`** to get comprehensive recommendations with reasoning:\n\n```bash\npython3 skills/ui-ux-pro-max/scripts/search.py \"<product_type> <industry> <keywords>\" --design-system [-p \"Project Name\"]\n```\n\nThis command:\n1. Searches 5 domains in parallel (product, style, color, landing, typography)\n2. Applies reasoning rules from `ui-reasoning.csv` to select best matches\n3. Returns complete design system: pattern, style, colors, typography, effects\n4. Includes anti-patterns to avoid\n\n**Example:**\n```bash\npython3 skills/ui-ux-pro-max/scripts/search.py \"beauty spa wellness service\" --design-system -p \"Serenity Spa\"\n```\n\n### Step 2b: Persist Design System (Master + Overrides Pattern)\n\nTo save the design system for **hierarchical retrieval across sessions**, add `--persist`:\n\n```bash\npython3 skills/ui-ux-pro-max/scripts/search.py \"<query>\" --design-system --persist -p \"Project Name\"\n```\n\nThis creates:\n- `design-system/MASTER.md` — Global Source of Truth with all design rules\n- `design-system/pages/` — Folder for page-specific overrides\n\n**With page-specific override:**\n```bash\npython3 skills/ui-ux-pro-max/scripts/search.py \"<query>\" --design-system --persist -p \"Project Name\" --page \"dashboard\"\n```\n\nThis also creates:\n- `design-system/pages/dashboard.md` — Page-specific deviations from Master\n\n**How hierarchical retrieval works:**\n1. When building a specific page (e.g., \"Checkout\"), first check `design-system/pages/checkout.md`\n2. If the page file exists, its rules **override** the Master file\n3. If not, use `design-system/MASTER.md` exclusively\n\n**Context-aware retrieval prompt:**\n```\nI am building the [Page Name] page. Please read design-system/MASTER.md.\nAlso check if design-system/pages/[page-name].md exists.\nIf the page file exists, prioritize its rules.\nIf not, use the Master rules exclusively.\nNow, generate the code...\n```\n\n### Step 3: Supplement with Detailed Searches (as needed)\n\nAfter getting the design system, use domain searches to get additional details:\n\n```bash\npython3 skills/ui-ux-pro-max/scripts/search.py \"<keyword>\" --domain <domain> [-n <max_results>]\n```\n\n**When to use detailed searches:**\n\n| Need | Domain | Example |\n|------|--------|---------|\n| More style options | `style` | `--domain style \"glassmorphism dark\"` |\n| Chart recommendations | `chart` | `--domain chart \"real-time dashboard\"` |\n| UX best practices | `ux` | `--domain ux \"animation accessibility\"` |\n| Alternative fonts | `typography` | `--domain typography \"elegant luxury\"` |\n| Landing structure | `landing` | `--domain landing \"hero social-proof\"` |\n\n### Step 4: Stack Guidelines (Default: html-tailwind)\n\nGet implementation-specific best practices. If user doesn't specify a stack, **default to `html-tailwind`**.\n\n```bash\npython3 skills/ui-ux-pro-max/scripts/search.py \"<keyword>\" --stack html-tailwind\n```\n\nAvailable stacks: `html-tailwind`, `react`, `nextjs`, `vue`, `svelte`, `swiftui`, `react-native`, `flutter`, `shadcn`, `jetpack-compose`\n\n---\n\n## Search Reference\n\n### Available Domains\n\n| Domain | Use For | Example Keywords |\n|--------|---------|------------------|\n| `product` | Product type recommendations | SaaS, e-commerce, portfolio, healthcare, beauty, service |\n| `style` | UI styles, colors, effects | glassmorphism, minimalism, dark mode, brutalism |\n| `typography` | Font pairings, Google Fonts | elegant, playful, professional, modern |\n| `color` | Color palettes by product type | saas, ecommerce, healthcare, beauty, fintech, service |\n| `landing` | Page structure, CTA strategies | hero, hero-centric, testimonial, pricing, social-proof |\n| `chart` | Chart types, library recommendations | trend, comparison, timeline, funnel, pie |\n| `ux` | Best practices, anti-patterns | animation, accessibility, z-index, loading |\n| `react` | React/Next.js performance | waterfall, bundle, suspense, memo, rerender, cache |\n| `web` | Web interface guidelines | aria, focus, keyboard, semantic, virtualize |\n| `prompt` | AI prompts, CSS keywords | (style name) |\n\n### Available Stacks\n\n| Stack | Focus |\n|-------|-------|\n| `html-tailwind` | Tailwind utilities, responsive, a11y (DEFAULT) |\n| `react` | State, hooks, performance, patterns |\n| `nextjs` | SSR, routing, images, API routes |\n| `vue` | Composition API, Pinia, Vue Router |\n| `svelte` | Runes, stores, SvelteKit |\n| `swiftui` | Views, State, Navigation, Animation |\n| `react-native` | Components, Navigation, Lists |\n| `flutter` | Widgets, State, Layout, Theming |\n| `shadcn` | shadcn/ui components, theming, forms, patterns |\n| `jetpack-compose` | Composables, Modifiers, State Hoisting, Recomposition |\n\n---\n\n## Example Workflow\n\n**User request:** \"Làm landing page cho dịch vụ chăm sóc da chuyên nghiệp\"\n\n### Step 1: Analyze Requirements\n- Product type: Beauty/Spa service\n- Style keywords: elegant, professional, soft\n- Industry: Beauty/Wellness\n- Stack: html-tailwind (default)\n\n### Step 2: Generate Design System (REQUIRED)\n\n```bash\npython3 skills/ui-ux-pro-max/scripts/search.py \"beauty spa wellness service elegant\" --design-system -p \"Serenity Spa\"\n```\n\n**Output:** Complete design system with pattern, style, colors, typography, effects, and anti-patterns.\n\n### Step 3: Supplement with Detailed Searches (as needed)\n\n```bash\n# Get UX guidelines for animation and accessibility\npython3 skills/ui-ux-pro-max/scripts/search.py \"animation accessibility\" --domain ux\n\n# Get alternative typography options if needed\npython3 skills/ui-ux-pro-max/scripts/search.py \"elegant luxury serif\" --domain typography\n```\n\n### Step 4: Stack Guidelines\n\n```bash\npython3 skills/ui-ux-pro-max/scripts/search.py \"layout responsive form\" --stack html-tailwind\n```\n\n**Then:** Synthesize design system + detailed searches and implement the design.\n\n---\n\n## Output Formats\n\nThe `--design-system` flag supports two output formats:\n\n```bash\n# ASCII box (default) - best for terminal display\npython3 skills/ui-ux-pro-max/scripts/search.py \"fintech crypto\" --design-system\n\n# Markdown - best for documentation\npython3 skills/ui-ux-pro-max/scripts/search.py \"fintech crypto\" --design-system -f markdown\n```\n\n---\n\n## Tips for Better Results\n\n1. **Be specific with keywords** - \"healthcare SaaS dashboard\" > \"app\"\n2. **Search multiple times** - Different keywords reveal different insights\n3. **Combine domains** - Style + Typography + Color = Complete design system\n4. **Always check UX** - Search \"animation\", \"z-index\", \"accessibility\" for common issues\n5. **Use stack flag** - Get implementation-specific best practices\n6. **Iterate** - If first search doesn't match, try different keywords\n\n---\n\n## Common Rules for Professional UI\n\nThese are frequently overlooked issues that make UI look unprofessional:\n\n### Icons & Visual Elements\n\n| Rule | Do | Don't |\n|------|----|----- |\n| **No emoji icons** | Use SVG icons (Heroicons, Lucide, Simple Icons) | Use emojis like 🎨 🚀 ⚙️ as UI icons |\n| **Stable hover states** | Use color/opacity transitions on hover | Use scale transforms that shift layout |\n| **Correct brand logos** | Research official SVG from Simple Icons | Guess or use incorrect logo paths |\n| **Consistent icon sizing** | Use fixed viewBox (24x24) with w-6 h-6 | Mix different icon sizes randomly |\n\n### Interaction & Cursor\n\n| Rule | Do | Don't |\n|------|----|----- |\n| **Cursor pointer** | Add `cursor-pointer` to all clickable/hoverable cards | Leave default cursor on interactive elements |\n| **Hover feedback** | Provide visual feedback (color, shadow, border) | No indication element is interactive |\n| **Smooth transitions** | Use `transition-colors duration-200` | Instant state changes or too slow (>500ms) |\n\n### Light/Dark Mode Contrast\n\n| Rule | Do | Don't |\n|------|----|----- |\n| **Glass card light mode** | Use `bg-white/80` or higher opacity | Use `bg-white/10` (too transparent) |\n| **Text contrast light** | Use `#0F172A` (slate-900) for text | Use `#94A3B8` (slate-400) for body text |\n| **Muted text light** | Use `#475569` (slate-600) minimum | Use gray-400 or lighter |\n| **Border visibility** | Use `border-gray-200` in light mode | Use `border-white/10` (invisible) |\n\n### Layout & Spacing\n\n| Rule | Do | Don't |\n|------|----|----- |\n| **Floating navbar** | Add `top-4 left-4 right-4` spacing | Stick navbar to `top-0 left-0 right-0` |\n| **Content padding** | Account for fixed navbar height | Let content hide behind fixed elements |\n| **Consistent max-width** | Use same `max-w-6xl` or `max-w-7xl` | Mix different container widths |\n\n---\n\n## Pre-Delivery Checklist\n\nBefore delivering UI code, verify these items:\n\n### Visual Quality\n- [ ] No emojis used as icons (use SVG instead)\n- [ ] All icons from consistent icon set (Heroicons/Lucide)\n- [ ] Brand logos are correct (verified from Simple Icons)\n- [ ] Hover states don't cause layout shift\n- [ ] Use theme colors directly (bg-primary) not var() wrapper\n\n### Interaction\n- [ ] All clickable elements have `cursor-pointer`\n- [ ] Hover states provide clear visual feedback\n- [ ] Transitions are smooth (150-300ms)\n- [ ] Focus states visible for keyboard navigation\n\n### Light/Dark Mode\n- [ ] Light mode text has sufficient contrast (4.5:1 minimum)\n- [ ] Glass/transparent elements visible in light mode\n- [ ] Borders visible in both modes\n- [ ] Test both modes before delivery\n\n### Layout\n- [ ] Floating elements have proper spacing from edges\n- [ ] No content hidden behind fixed navbars\n- [ ] Responsive at 375px, 768px, 1024px, 1440px\n- [ ] No horizontal scroll on mobile\n\n### Accessibility\n- [ ] All images have alt text\n- [ ] Form inputs have labels\n- [ ] Color is not the only indicator\n- [ ] `prefers-reduced-motion` respected"

  tabindex=\"0\"\n     aria-labelledby=\"label\">\n</div>\n<span id=\"label\">Accept terms</span>\n````\n\n### 4.1.3 Status Messages (Level AA)\n\n- [ ] Status updates announced\n- [ ] Live regions used correctly\n\n```html\n<div role=\"status\" aria-live=\"polite\">3 items added to cart</div>\n\n<div role=\"alert\" aria-live=\"assertive\">Error: Form submission failed</div>\n```\n\n````\n\n## Automated Testing\n\n```javascript\n// axe-core integration\nconst axe = require('axe-core');\n\nasync function runAccessibilityAudit(page) {\n  await page.addScriptTag({ path: require.resolve('axe-core') });\n\n  const results = await page.evaluate(async () => {\n    return await axe.run(document, {\n      runOnly: {\n        type: 'tag',\n        values: ['wcag2a', 'wcag2aa', 'wcag21aa', 'wcag22aa']\n      }\n    });\n  });\n\n  return {\n    violations: results.violations,\n    passes: results.passes,\n    incomplete: results.incomplete\n  };\n}\n\n// Playwright test example\ntest('should have no accessibility violations', async ({ page }) => {\n  await page.goto('/');\n  const results = await runAccessibilityAudit(page);\n\n  expect(results.violations).toHaveLength(0);\n});\n````\n\n```bash\n# CLI tools\nnpx @axe-core/cli https://example.com\nnpx pa11y https://example.com\nlighthouse https://example.com --only-categories=accessibility\n```\n\n## Remediation Patterns\n\n### Fix: Missing Form Labels\n\n```html\n<!-- Before -->\n<input type=\"email\" placeholder=\"Email\" />\n\n<!-- After: Option 1 - Visible label -->\n<label for=\"email\">Email address</label>\n<input id=\"email\" type=\"email\" />\n\n<!-- After: Option 2 - aria-label -->\n<input type=\"email\" aria-label=\"Email address\" />\n\n<!-- After: Option 3 - aria-labelledby -->\n<span id=\"email-label\">Email</span>\n<input type=\"email\" aria-labelledby=\"email-label\" />\n```\n\n### Fix: Insufficient Color Contrast\n\n```css\n/* Before: 2.5:1 contrast */\n.text {\n  color: #767676;\n}\n\n/* After: 4.5:1 contrast */\n.text {\n  color: #595959;\n}\n\n/* Or add background */\n.text {\n  color: #767676;\n  background: #000;\n}\n```\n\n### Fix: Keyboard Navigation\n\n```javascript\n// Make custom element keyboard accessible\nclass AccessibleDropdown extends HTMLElement {\n  connectedCallback() {\n    this.setAttribute(\"tabindex\", \"0\");\n    this.setAttribute(\"role\", \"combobox\");\n    this.setAttribute(\"aria-expanded\", \"false\");\n\n    this.addEventListener(\"keydown\", (e) => {\n      switch (e.key) {\n        case \"Enter\":\n        case \" \":\n          this.toggle();\n          e.preventDefault();\n          break;\n        case \"Escape\":\n          this.close();\n          break;\n        case \"ArrowDown\":\n          this.focusNext();\n          e.preventDefault();\n          break;\n        case \"ArrowUp\":\n          this.focusPrevious();\n          e.preventDefault();\n          break;\n      }\n    });\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Best Practices\n\n### Do's\n\n- **Start early** - Accessibility from design phase\n- **Test with real users** - Disabled users provide best feedback\n- **Automate what you can** - 30-50% issues detectable\n- **Use semantic HTML** - Reduces ARIA needs\n- **Document patterns** - Build accessible component library\n\n### Don'ts\n\n- **Don't rely only on automated testing** - Manual testing required\n- **Don't use ARIA as first solution** - Native HTML first\n- **Don't hide focus outlines** - Keyboard users need them\n- **Don't disable zoom** - Users need to resize\n- **Don't use color alone** - Multiple indicators needed\n\n## Resources\n\n- [WCAG 2.2 Guidelines](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/)\n-
